<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not my purpose to contribute to the study
of woman’s intellectual life, or to discuss her
capacity for artistic production, although these six
women are in a manner representative of woman’s
intellect and woman’s creative faculty. I have
little to do with Marie Bashkirtseff’s pictures in
the Luxembourg, Sonia Kovalevsky’s doctor’s degree
and <i>Prix Bordin</i>, Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler’s
stories and social dramas, Eleonora Duse’s
success as a tragedian in both worlds, and with all
that has made their names famous and is publicly
known about them. There is only one point which
I should like to emphasize in these six types of
modern womanhood, and that is the manifestation
of their womanly feelings. I want to show how
it asserts itself in spite of everything,—in spite of
the theories on which they built up their lives,
in spite of the opinions of which they were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
teachers, and in spite of the success which crowned
their efforts, and bound them by stronger chains
than might have been the case had their lives been
passed in obscurity. They were out of harmony
with themselves, suffering from a conflict which
made its first appearance in the world when the
“woman question” came to the fore, causing an
unnatural breach between the needs of the intellect
and the requirements of their womanly nature.
Most of them succumbed in the struggle.</p>

<p>A woman who seeks freedom by means of the
modern method of independence is generally one
who desires to escape from a woman’s sufferings.
She is anxious to avoid subjection, also motherhood,
and the dependence and impersonality of
an ordinary woman’s life; but in doing so she unconsciously
deprives herself of her womanliness.
For them all—for Marie Bashkirtseff as much as
Sonia Kovalevsky and A. C. Edgren-Leffler—the
day came when they found themselves standing
at the door of the heart’s innermost sanctuary,
and realized that they were excluded. Some of
them burst open the door, entered, and became
man’s once more. Others remained outside and
died there. They were all individualistic, these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
six women. It was this fact that moulded their
destiny; but Eleonora Duse was the only one of
them who was individualistic enough. None of
them were able to stand alone, as more than one
had believed that she could. The women of our
day are difficult in the choice of a husband, and
the men are slow and mistrustful in their search
for a wife.</p>

<p>There are some hidden peculiarities in woman’s
soul which I have traced in the lives of these
six representative women, and I have written
them down for the benefit of those who have
not had the opportunity of discovering them for
themselves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subjects of these six psychological sketches
are well known to English readers, with the
exception of Amalie Skram, the Norwegian
novelist, and Fru Leffler, who is known only as
the biographer of Sonia Kovalevsky.</p>

<p>Laura Marholm, the writer of this book, is a
German authoress of Norwegian extraction, who
is celebrated for her literary criticisms and the
beauty of her style. In September, 1889, she
married Ola Hansson, the Swedish author of
“Sensitiva Amorosa,” “Young Scandinavia,” and
a novel called “Fru Esther Bruce,” in which the
heroine is said to bear a strong resemblance to
Eleonora Duse. He has also published a volume
of prose poems, called “Ofeg’s Ditties,” which
has been translated by George Egerton, whose
vivid style and powerful descriptions have gained
a place for her among the foremost women writers
of the day.</p>

<p>Laura Marholm was the first to introduce her
husband to the German public by means of two
articles in the <i>Neue Freie Presse</i>. The first,
called “A Swedish Love Poet,” appeared May<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
24th, 1888, before they had met, and was written
in praise of his early work, “Sensitiva Amorosa.”
The second article was a criticism on “Pariahs,”
and it is an interesting fact that in it she compares
him to Gottfried Keller.</p>

<p>In all her writings, Laura Marholm looks at
life through the spectacles of a happy marriage;
she believes that matured thought and widened
views can—in a woman’s case—be only the
direct result of marriage; and consequently she
considers marriage to be absolutely indispensable
to every woman, and that without it she is both
mentally and morally undeveloped. She has little
sympathy with the Woman’s Rights movement,
judged either from the social, political, or educational
point of view; with regard to the latter,
she has not had a university education herself,
and she is not at all impressed by those who have.
She considers that a woman’s individuality is of
greater importance than her actions; she upholds
woman’s influence <i>as woman</i>, and has no sympathy
with the advanced thinkers, who, with Stuart Mill
at their head, would fain have women exert their
influence as thinking, reasoning human beings,
believing all other influence to be unworthy the
dignity of the modern woman. Laura Marholm
has the intuitive faculty, and this enables her to
gauge the feelings of those women who spend a
long youth in waiting—who are taught to believe,
and who do believe, that their youth is nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
more than a transition period between childhood
and marriage,—women who grow old in waiting,
and awake to reality to find behind them nothing
but a wasted youth, and in the future—an empty
old age. But these are not modern women, they
are the women of the <i>ancien régime</i>, who have
missed their vocation, and failed to attain their
sole object in life,—viz., marriage. On the one
hand we are confronted with the old-fashioned
girl, on the other by the new woman. Of the
two, we prefer the new woman; and while recognizing
her mistakes, and lamenting her exaggerated
views, Laura Marholm acknowledges that
she is formed of the best material of the age, and
prophesies for her a brighter future. But her
views differ greatly from those of Ibsen and
Björnson. According to Ibsen, a woman is first
of all a human being, and then a woman; she
places the woman first, the human being last.
Björnson believes that an intellectually developed
woman with a life-work can get on very well
by herself; Laura Marholm maintains that, apart
from man, a woman is nothing. According to
her, woman is a creature of instinct, and this
instinct is her most precious possession, and of
far greater value than the intellect. Of all the
studies in this book, Fru Leffler is probably the
one with whom she is least in sympathy. Fru
Leffler was essentially intellectual, possessed of
a somewhat cold and critical temperament, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>
writing the biography of Sonia Kovalevsky she
was often unable to appreciate the latter’s very
complicated character. Sonia was a rare combination
of the mystic and the scientist; she was
not only a mathematician, but also, in every important
crisis of her life, a dreamer of prophetic
dreams. The biography was intended to be the
continuation of Sonia’s own story of her childhood,
and the two should be read together. As
a child, Sonia suffered from a painful conviction
that in her family she was not the favorite, and
it is probable that her unaccountable shyness,
her want of self-confidence, and her inability to
attract love in after life, were due to the fact
of her having passed an unhappy and unloved
childhood.</p>

<p>Fru Leffler’s writings are remarkable for the
simplicity and directness of her style, her keen
observation, and love of truth. Her talents were
by no means confined to her pen; she held a
salon,—the resort of the intellectual world of
Stockholm,—and attained great popularity by her
tactfulness and social gifts. She did not, however,
shine in society to the same extent as Sonia
Kovalevsky. Her conversation was not as brilliant
and witty as the latter’s, but it was always
interesting, and it was of the kind that is remembered
long afterwards. “When she told a story,
analyzed a psychological problem, or recounted
the contents of a book, she always succeeded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span>
setting forth its real character in a clear and
decided manner.” Sonia, on the other hand, was
ever ready with an original remark. Ellen Key
tells how one day, when the conversation turned
upon love, Sonia exclaimed: “These amiable
young men are always writing books about love,
and they do not even know that some people have
a genius for loving, just as others have a genius
for music and mechanics, and that for these
erotic geniuses love is a matter of life and death,
whereas for others it is only an episode.”</p>

<p>Fru Leffler travelled a great deal, and made
many friends in the countries that she visited.
She took great interest in socialism, anarchism,
and all religious and educational movements. In
London she attended lectures given by Mrs. Marx-Aveling,
Bradlaugh, and Mrs. Besant. Theosophy,
positivism, spiritualism, and atheism,—there
was nothing which did not interest her.
The more she saw the more she doubted the possibility
of attaining to absolute truth in matters
either social or religious, and the more attracted
she became by the doctrine of evolution.</p>

<p>From this authoress, who was the chief exponent
of woman’s rights in Sweden, we turn to a very
different but no less interesting type. Eleonora
Duse, the great Italian actress, has visited London
during the past few years, acting in such a
natural, and at the same time in such a simple
and life-like manner, that a knowledge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>
language was not absolutely indispensable to the
enjoyment of the piece. Besides most of the
pieces mentioned here, she acted in <i>La Femme de
Claude</i>, <i>Cleopatra</i>, and <i>Martha</i>; but she attained
her greatest triumph in Goldoni’s comedy, <i>La
Locandiera</i>.</p>

<p>In all these typical women, Fru L. Marholm
Hansson traces a likeness which proves that they
have something in common. Numerous and conflicting
as are the various opinions on the so-called
“woman question,” the best, and perhaps the only,
way of elucidating it is by doing as she has done
in giving us these sketches. We have here six
modern women belonging to five nationalities,
three of whom are authoresses, and the other
three—mathematician, actress, and artist, portrayed
and criticised by one who is herself a
modern woman and an authoress.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> sometimes happens that a hidden characteristic
of the age is disclosed, not through any acuteness
on the part of the spectator, nor as the result of
critical research, but of itself, as it were, and
spontaneously. A worn face rises before us, bearing
the marks of death, and never again may we
gaze into the eyes which reveal the deep psychological
life of the soul. It is the dead who greet
us, the dead who survive us, and who will come
to life again and again in future generations, long
after we have ceased to be; those dead who will become
the living, only to suffer and to die again.</p>

<p>These self-revelations have always existed
amongst men, but among women they were unknown
until now, when this tired century is drawing
to its close. It is one of the strangest signs
of the coming age that woman has attained to the
intellectual consciousness of herself as woman, and
can say what she is, what she wishes, and what she
longs for. But she pays for this knowledge with
her death.</p>

<p>Marie Bashkirtseff’s Journal was just such a
self-revelation as this; the moment it appeared it
was carried throughout the whole of Europe, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
further than Europe, on far-reaching waves of
human sympathy. Wherever it went it threw a
firebrand into the women’s hearts, which set them
burning without most of them knowing what this
burning betokened. They read the book with a
strange and painful emotion, for as they turned
over these pages so full of ardent energy, tears,
and yearning, they beheld their own selves,
strange, beautiful, and exalted, but still themselves,
though few of them could have explained
why or wherefore.</p>

<p>It was no bitter struggle with the outer world to
which Marie Bashkirtseff succumbed at the age of
four-and-twenty; it was not the struggle of a girl
of the middle classes for her daily bread, for which
she sacrifices her youth and spirits; she met with
no obstacles beyond the traditional customs which
had become to her a second nature, no obstruction
greater than the atmosphere of the age in which
she lived, which bounded her own horizon, although
in her inmost soul she rebelled against it. She
had everything that the world can give to assist
the unhindered development of the inner life,—mental,
spiritual, and physical; everything that
hundreds of thousands of women, whose narrow
lives need expanding, have not got,—and yet she
did not live her life. On every one of the six
hundred pages of her journal (written, as it is, in
her penetrating Russian-French style) we meet
the despairing cry that she had nothing, that she
was ever alone in the midst of an everlasting void,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
hungering at the table of life, spread for every
one except herself, standing with hands outstretched
as the days passed by and gave her nothing;
youth and health were fading fast, the grave
was yawning, just a little chink, then wider and
wider, and she must go down without having had
anything but work,—constant work,—trouble and
striving, and the empty fame which gives a stone
in the place of bread.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The tired and discontented women of the time
recognized themselves on every page, and for many
of them Marie Bashkirtseff’s Journal became a
kind of secret Bible in which they read a few sentences
every morning, or at night before going to
sleep.</p>

<p>A few years later there appeared another confession
by a woman; this time it was not an
autobiography, like the last one, but it was written
by a friend, who was a European celebrity, with a
name as lasting as her own. This book was called
“Sonia Kovalevsky: Our Mutual Experiences,
and the things she told me about herself.” The
writer was Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler, Duchess
of Cajanello, who had been her daily companion
during years of friendship.</p>

<p>There was a curious likeness between Marie
Bashkirtseff’s Journal and Sonia Kovalevsky’s
confessions, something in their innermost, personal
experiences which proves an identity of temperament
as well as of fortune, something which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
was not only due to the unconscious manner in
which they criticised life, but to life itself, life
as they moulded it, and as each was destined to
live it. Marie Bashkirtseff and Sonia Kovalevsky
were both Russians,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> both descended from rich
and noble families, both women of genius, and
from their earliest childhood they were both in a
position to obtain all the advantages of a good
education. They were both born rulers, true children
of nature, full of originality, proud and independent.
In all respects they were the favorites
of fortune, and yet—and yet neither of these
extraordinary women was satisfied, and they died
because they could not be satisfied. Is not this a
sign of the times?</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> story of Sonia Kovalevsky’s life reads like
an exciting novel, which is, if anything, too richly
furnished with strange events. Such is life. It
comes with hands full to its chosen ones, but it
also takes away gifts more priceless than it gave.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen Sonia Kovalevsky was
already the mistress of her own fate. She had
married the husband of her choice, and he had
accompanied her to Heidelberg, where they both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
matriculated at the university. From thence he
took her to Berlin, where she lived with a girl
friend, who was a student like herself, and studied
mathematics at Weierstrass’s for the space of four
years, only meeting her husband occasionally in
the course of her walks. Her marriage with
Valdemar Kovalevsky, afterwards Professor of
Paleontology at the university of Moscow, was a
mere formality, and this extraordinary circumstance
brings us face to face with one of the chief
characteristics of her nature.</p>

<p>Sonia Kovalevsky did not love her husband;
there was, in fact, nothing in her early youth to
which she was less disposed than love. She was
possessed of an immense undefined thirst, which
was something more than a thirst for study, albeit
that was the form which it took. Her inexperienced,
child-like nature was weighed down beneath
the burden of an exceptional talent.</p>

<p>Sonia Krukovsky was the daughter of General
Krukovsky of Palibino, a French Grand-seigneur
of old family; and when she was no more than
sixteen, she had in her the making of a great
mathematician and a great authoress. She was
fully aware of the first, but of the latter she knew
nothing, for a woman’s literary talent nearly always
dates its origin from her experience of life. She
was high-spirited and enterprising,—qualities
which are more often found among the Sclavonic
women than any other race of Europeans; she had
that peculiar consciousness of the shortness of life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the same which drove Marie Bashkirtseff to accomplish
more in the course of a few years than most
people would have achieved during the course of
their whole existence.</p>

<p>Sonia Kovalevsky’s girlhood was spent in
Russia, during those years of feverish excitement
when the outbreaks of the Nihilists bore witness
to the working of a subterranean volcano, and the
hearts and intellects of the young glowed with an
enthusiasm which led to the self-annihilating deeds
of fanaticism. A few winter months spent at St.
Petersburg decided the fate of Sonia and her elder
sister, Anjuta. The strict, old-fashioned notions
of their family allowed them very little liberty,
and they longed for independence. In order to
escape from parental authority, a formal marriage
was at this time a very favorite expedient among
young girls in Russia. A silent but widespread
antagonism reigned in all circles between the old
and young; the latter treated one another as secret
allies, who by a look or pressure of the hand could
make themselves understood. It was not at all
uncommon for a girl to propose a formal marriage
to a young man, generally with the purpose of
studying abroad, as this was the only means by
which they could obtain the consent of their unsuspecting
parents to undertake the journey.
When they were abroad, they generally released
each other from all claims and separated, in order
to study apart. Sonia’s sister was anxious to
escape in this way, as she possessed a remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
literary talent which her father had forbidden her
to exercise. She accordingly made the proposal
in question to a young student of good family,
named Valdemar Kovalevsky; he, however, preferred
Sonia, and this gave rise to further complications,
as their father refused to allow the
younger sister to marry before the elder.</p>

<p>Sonia resorted to a stratagem, and one evening,
when her parents were giving a reception, she
went secretly to Valdemar, and as soon as her
absence was discovered she sent a note to her
father, with these words: “I am with Valdemar;
do not oppose our marriage any longer.” There
remained no alternative for General Krukovsky
but to fetch his daughter home as speedily as
possible, and to announce her engagement.</p>

<p>They were accompanied on their honeymoon by
a girl friend, who was equally imbued with the
desire to study, and soon afterwards Anjuta joined
them. The first thing that Sonia and Valdemar
did was to visit George Eliot in London; after
which Valdemar went to Jena and Munich, while
Sonia, with her sister and friend, studied at Heidelberg,
where they remained during two terms before
going to Berlin. The sister went secretly to Paris
by herself.</p>

<p>Arrived at Berlin, Sonia buried herself in her
work. She saw no one except Professor Weierstrass,
who expressed the greatest admiration for
her quickness at mathematics, and did all in his
power to assist her by means of private lessons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
If we are honest enough to call it by its true
name, we must confess that the life led by these
two girls, during eight terms, was the life of a
dog. Sonia scarcely ever went out of doors unless
Valdemar fetched her for a walk, which was not
often, as he lived in another part of the town, and
was constantly away. She was tormented with a
vague fear of exposing herself. Inexperienced as
both these friends were, they lived poorly, and ate
little, allowing themselves no pleasure of any
sort, added to which they were tyrannized over and
cheated by their maid-servant. Sonia sat all day
long at her writing-table, hard at work with her
mathematical exercises; and when she took a short
rest, it was only to run up and down the room,
talking aloud to herself, with her brains as busy as
ever. She had never been accustomed to do anything
for herself; she had always been waited
upon, and it was impossible to persuade her even
to buy a dress when necessary, unless Valdemar
accompanied her. But Valdemar soon tired of
rendering these unrequited services, and he often
absented himself in other towns for the completion
of his own studies; and as they both received an
abundant supply of money from their respective
homes, they were in no way dependent upon each
other.</p>

<p>The year 1870 came and went; for Sonia it had
been a year of study, and nothing more. Her
sleep had become shorter and more broken, and
she neither knew nor cared what she ate, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
suddenly, in the spring of the following year,
she was sent for by her sister in Paris. Anjuta
had fallen passionately in love with a young
Parisian, who was a member of the Commune; he
had just been arrested, and was in danger of losing
his life. Sonia and Valdemar succeeded in penetrating
through the line of troops, found Anjuta,
and wrote to their father. General Krukovsky came
at once, and it was only then that he discovered
what his daughters were doing abroad, and learned
for the first time that his eldest daughter had been
living alone in Paris, for Anjuta had always been
careful to send her letters through Sonia, with the
Berlin postmark.</p>

<p>Anjuta showed great spirit, and after an interview
with Thiers they succeeded in helping this
very undesirable son-in-law to escape. Throughout
the whole affair their father’s behavior is a
rare proof of the nobility of the race from which
Sonia sprang. This stern man not only forgave—he
also admired his daughters for what they
had done. The cold manner and grandfatherly
authority with which he had hitherto treated them
was superseded by a cordial sympathy such as
would have been impossible before. He was much
impressed by Anjuta’s passion, but Sonia’s platonic
marriage distressed him greatly.</p>

<p>In the year 1874 Sonia took the degree of doctor
at Göttingen, as the result of three mathematical
treatises, of which one especially, her thesis “On
the Theory of Partial Differential Equations,” is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
reckoned one of her most prominent works. Immediately
after this, the whole family assembled on
the old estate of Palibino. Sonia was completely
worn out, and it was a long time before she was
able to resume any severe brain work. Her holiday
was cut short by her father’s death a few
months later, and the following winter was spent
with her family at St. Petersburg. Until now
Sonia’s brain was the only part of her which was
thoroughly awakened. She had been entirely
absorbed in her studies, and had worked with the
obstinate tenacity of auto-suggestion, more commonly
found in women, especially girls, than in
men. Marie Bashkirtseff had done the same, year
in, year out; she had worked breathlessly, feverishly,
with an incomprehensible, unwearied power
of production,—while failing health was announcing
the approach of death in her frail young body.
Suddenly the end came.</p>

<p>Thousands of girls in middle-class families work
themselves to death in the same way. Badly paid
to begin with, they lower the prices still more by
competing with one another. Others, placed in
better circumstances, work with the same insistency
at useless handicrafts, while a large number
of women of the poorer classes work because they
are driven to it by dire necessity. The result is
the same in all cases; they lose the power of
enjoyment, and forget what happiness means.</p>

<p>Sonia’s stay in St. Petersburg was the occasion
of the first great change which took place in her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
to be followed later on by many like changes.
Mathematics were thrust aside; she did not want
to hear any more about them, she wanted to forget
them.</p>

<p>Mind and body were undergoing a healing
process, struggling to attain an even balance in
her fresh young nature. She felt the need of
change, she required companionship, and she threw
herself into the midst of all social and intellectual
pursuits. It was then that the woman awoke in
her.</p>

<p>During the period of nervous excitement and
sorrow which followed after the death of her
beloved father, she had become the wife of her
husband, after having been nominally married for
nearly seven years. Since then they had drawn
closer to one another; and now that her fortune,
as long as her mother lived, was not sufficient for
her support, she and Valdemar invested their
money in various speculations. With true Russian
enthusiasm they set to work building houses,
establishing watering-places, and starting newspapers,
besides lending their aid to every imaginable
kind of new invention. The first year all
went well, and in 1878 a daughter was born.
After that came the crash. Kovalevsky was bitten
with the rage for speculation, and although he was
nominated Professor of Paleontology at Moscow in
1880, and in spite of all that his wife could do to
dissuade him, he took shares in a company connected
with petroleum springs in the south of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Russia. The company was a swindle, the undertaking
proved a failure, and he shot himself.</p>

<p>Sonia had left him some time before. She knew
what was coming, having been warned by bad
dreams and presentiments, and as she had lost her
influence over him, and was anxious to provide for
her own and her child’s future, she left him and
went to Paris. Just as she was recovering from
the nervous fever to which she succumbed on hearing
the news of her husband’s sudden death, she
received the summons to go to Stockholm.</p>

<p>The invitation had been sent by the representatives
of a Woman’s Rights movement which was
then in full swing. It was an exceedingly narrow
society of the genuine <i>bourgeois</i> kind, and as it
was to them that she owed her appointment, they
were anxious to bind her firmly to their cause.
Sonia soon won their hearts by the sociability of
her Russian nature, but as one term after the other
passed by, she grew more and more weary of it, and
whenever her course of lectures was over she hurried
away as quickly as possible to Russia, Italy,
France, England,—no matter where, if only she
could escape out of Sweden into a freer atmosphere.
She never looked upon her stay there as anything
more than an episode in her life, and she longed
to be back in Paris; but the years passed by, and
she received no other appointment.</p>

<p>Her lectures at the university began to pall upon
her; it gave her no pleasure to be forever teaching
the students the same thing in a dreary routine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
She needed an incentive in the shape of some
highly gifted individual whom she could respect,
and whose presence would call forth her highest
faculties; but even the esteem in which she held
some few people was not of long duration.</p>

<p>Her friendship with Fru Edgren-Leffler dates
from this period. It was this lady’s renown as an
authoress which roused Sonia’s talent for writing,
for her life had been rich in experiences, and
never wanting in variety until now, when, in a
period of comparative leisure, she allowed her
thoughts to dwell upon the past. She began by
persuading Fru Edgren-Leffler to dramatize the
sketches which she gave her, and “The Struggle
for Happiness” was the first result of this collaboration.
But Sonia soon realized that the
honest, simple-minded Swede was not in sympathy
with this department of literature; so she wrote a
story on her own account, entitled “The Sisters
Rajevsky,” which was a sketch of her own youth,
followed by an excellent novel called “Vera
Barantzova;” after which she began another novel
called “Vae Victis,” which was never finished.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Up</span> till now we have followed this remarkable
woman’s life along a clear, though somewhat
agitated course; but from henceforward there is
something uncomfortable, something strange and
distorted about it. It is very difficult for us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
ascertain the cause of her increasing distraction of
mind, and early death, and the difficulty is intensified
by the fact that the material contributed by
Fru Leffler is poor and contradictory, and also
because her work is disfigured by the peculiar
inferences which she draws.</p>

<p>I have seen four portraits of Sonia Kovalevsky,
and they are all so entirely different that no one
would imagine that they were intended to represent
the same person. She had none of the fascinating,
though irregular beauty of Marie Bashkirtseff,
who carried on an artistic cult with her own person.
Sonia’s powerful head, with the short hair,
massive forehead, and short-sighted eyes of the
color of “green gooseberries in syrup,” was placed
on a delicate child-like body. Her chief charm
lay in her extraordinary liveliness and habit of
giving herself up entirely to the interest of the
moment; but she was completely unversed in the
art of dress, and did not know how to appear at her
best; she never gave any thought to the subject
at all until she was thirty; and although she paid
more attention to it then, she never learned the
secret. She aged early, and a celebrated poet has
described her to me as being a withered little old
woman at the age of thirty. These external circumstances
stood more in her way in Sweden,
among a tall, fair people, than would have been
possible either in Russia or in Paris. Between
herself and the Swedish type there was a wide gulf
fixed, which allowed no encouragement to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
finer erotic emotions to which she was very strongly
disposed; she felt crushed, and her impressionable,
unattractive nature suffered acutely from being so
unlike the ordinary victorious type of beauty. The
picture of her when she was eighteen bears a strong
resemblance to the late King Louis II. of Bavaria;
not only are her features like his, but also the expression
in the eyes and the curve of the lips. The
second picture dates from the year 1887. It has
something wearied and disillusioned about it, and
she seems to be making an effort to appear amiable.
It was taken at the time when she was struggling
to accustom herself to the stiff, prudish, and somewhat
pretentious ways of Stockholm society. The
third portrait was taken at the time when she won
the <i>Prix Bordin</i> in Paris, and it is a regular
Russian face, with a much more cheerful expression
than the former ones. But in the last picture,
taken in the year 1890, which was, to a certain
extent, official and very much touched up, how
ill she looks; how disappointed and how weary!
These four portraits are, to my mind, four different
women; they show us what Sonia was once,
and what she became after living for several years
in an uncongenial atmosphere.</p>

<p>Sonia Kovalevsky was a true Russian genius,
with an elastic nature. She was lavish and careless
in her ways, and she thrived best upon a torn
sofa in an atmosphere of tea, cigarettes, and profusion
of all kinds,—intellectual, spiritual, and
pecuniary; she needed to be surrounded by people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
like herself, who were in sympathy with her, and
the inhabitants of Stockholm were never that.
She had been torn away from the Russian surroundings
in which she had lived in Berlin. She,
who never could endure solitude, found herself
alone among strangers, who forced themselves upon
her,—hard, angular, women’s rights women, who
expected her to be their leader, and to fulfil a
mission. She seldom rebelled against the duties
which were constantly held before her eyes, partly
because her vanity was flattered by the public
position which she occupied, and also because her
livelihood depended upon it, now that her private
means were not sufficient for her support, and for
the numerous journeys which she undertook.</p>

<p>A great deal of her time was spent in travelling
to and fro between Stockholm and St. Petersburg,
where she went to visit Anjuta, whose marriage
had turned out most unhappily, and who was suffering
from a severe illness, of which she afterwards
died. After her sister’s death Sonia took a
great interest in the study of Northern literature,
which was then just beginning to attract attention.
She also wrote books, and solved some
mathematical problems. Every time that she returned
to Stockholm, after spending her holidays
in Russia or the South, she had almost entirely
forgotten her Swedish, and every year that passed
by called forth fresh lamentations over her exile.
The tone of society in Stockholm was unendurable
to her; but she was of too disciplined a character,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
and too gentle, too submissive in her loneliness,
to rebel against it. Her life became monotonous,
which it had never been before, and her courage
began to give way. She yearned for sympathy,
for excitement, for her native land,—for everything,
in fact, which was denied her.</p>

<p>She also longed for something else, which was
the very thing that she could not have. She was
seized with an eager, nervous longing to be loved.
She wanted to be a woman, to possess a woman’s
charm. She had lived like a widow for years
during her husband’s lifetime, and for years after
his death as well. As long as her mathematical
studies produced a tension in her mind, she
asked for nothing better, but buried herself in
her work, and was perfectly contented. When she
started being an authoress, a change came over her
character. The development of the imagination
created a need for love, and because this devouring
need could not be satisfied, she became exacting,
discontented, and mistrustful of the amount of
affection which was accorded her. In her younger
days she had asked for nothing more than that
curious kind of mystic love, known only to Russians,
which had run its course in mutual enthusiasm of
a purely intellectual and spiritual character. It
was otherwise now. She lamented her lost youth,
and the time wasted in study; she regretted the
unfortunate talent which had deprived her womanhood
of its attractiveness. She wanted to be a
woman, and to enjoy life as a woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>She had also another wish, just as passionate in
its way and as difficult of fulfilment as the former
one, and this was her wish to receive an appointment
in Paris. It was to a certain extent fulfilled
when she was awarded the <i>Prix Bordin</i> on Christmas
Eve, 1888, on the occasion of a solemn session
of the French Academy of Science, in an
assembly which was largely composed of learned
men. It was the highest scientific distinction
which had ever been accorded to a woman, and
from henceforth she was an European celebrity,
with a place in history. But it gave her no pleasure.
She was as completely knocked up as she
had been after receiving her doctor’s degree. She
had worked day and night for days beforehand,
and during the weeks that followed she took part
in the social functions which were given in her
honor. She left no pleasure untasted, and yet she
was not satisfied, for by this time her yearning for
love had reached its highest pitch.</p>

<p>A short time before, Sonia had made the acquaintance
of a cousin of her late husband’s, “fat
M.,” as she called him. The companionship of
a sympathetic fellow-countryman put her in the
height of good humor, and she soon found it so
indispensable that she wanted to have him always
at her side, and was never happy except when he
was there. M. K. did not return this strong affection;
he was, however, quite willing to marry her,
and the result was that a most unfortunate relationship
sprang up between them. Sonia could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
not exist without him, so they travelled from
Stockholm to Russia, and from Russia to Paris or
Italy, in order to spend a few weeks together, and
then separated, because by that time they were
mutually tired of each other. It was on one of
these journeys, when Sonia had come out of the
sunshine of Italy into the winter of Sweden, that
she caught cold, and no sooner had she arrived at
Stockholm than she did everything to make her
condition worse. In a desperate mood of indifference
she immediately commenced her lectures, and
went to all the social entertainments that were
given. Dark presentiments and dreams, in which
she always believed, had foretold that this year
would be fatal to her. Longing for death, yet
fearing it, she died suddenly in the beginning of
the year 1891.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who know something about Russian women,
without having any very detailed knowledge, divide
them into two types, and a superficial observer
would class Sonia Kovalevsky as belonging to one
or the other of these. The first type consists of
luxurious, languishing, idle, fascinating women,
with passionate black eyes, or playful gray ones, a
soft skin, and a delicate mouth, which is admirably
adapted for laughing and eating. These women
have a most seductive charm; their movements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
suggest that they are wont to recline on soft pillows,
dressed <i>en négligé</i>, and their power of chattering
is unlimited, and varies in tone from the
most enchanting flattery to the worst temper imaginable.
They are, in fact, the most womanly of
women, as little to be depended upon in their
amiability as in their anger; they are quick to
fall in love, and men are as quickly enthralled by
them. But Sonia Kovalevsky was not one of
these.</p>

<p>The women of the second type present the
greatest contrast that it is possible to imagine.
They are honest and straightforward, and essentially
what is called “a good fellow,” plain, sensible,
brave, energetic, as strong in soul as in
body,—thinking heads, flat figures; they have
none of that grace of form which is peculiar to a
large number of Russian women. Their faces are
generally sallow, and their skin is clammy, but
thoroughly Russian in spite of it. There is something
lacking in them, which for want of a better
expression I shall call a want of sweetness. There
is a curious neutrality about them; it takes one
some time to realize that they are women. And
they themselves are but dimly conscious of it, and
then only on rare occasions. They are generally
people with a mission,—working people, people
with ideas.</p>

<p>It is these women who have furnished the
largest contingent to the ranks of the Nihilists.
It is they who chose to lead the lives of hunted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
wild beasts, and who found ample compensation in
mental excitement for all that they had renounced
as women and as persons of refinement. But
although this last is a genuine Russian type, it
is by no means confined to Russia. It is a type
peculiar to the age. The class of women who become
Nihilists in Russia are the champions for
women’s rights in Sweden, and it is they who
agitate for women’s franchise in England, who
start women’s clubs in America, and become
governesses in Germany.</p>

<p>The type is universal, but it is left to circumstances
to decide which special form of mania it
is to take,—a form of mania which calls itself
“a vocation in life.” In Russia the woman, in
whom sex lay dormant, felt it her calling to become
a murderess, and that merely from a general
desire to promote the popular welfare; in Germany
this philanthropic spirit took the form of wishing
to prune little human plants in the Kindergarten.
But this is a long chapter, which I cannot pursue
any further at present, and which, like many others
on the characteristics of the woman of to-day, I
shall keep for a separate book. We must include
Sonia Kovalevsky in this latter type: she considered
herself as belonging to it, and the whole
course of her life is in itself sufficient to prove
that she was one of them. The nature of her
friendships with men furnishes us with yet another
proof. She had a large circle of acquaintances,
amongst whom were some of the best known and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
most talented men of Russia, Scandinavia, England,
Germany, France, and Italy,—all of whom
enjoyed her society, although not one of them
fell in love with her, and not one among those
thousands said to her, “I cannot exist without
you.”</p>

<p>She belonged to the class of women with brains,
and she was numbered amongst them. She was
their triumphant banner, the emblem of their
greatest victory, and their appointed Professor.
“She did not need the lower pleasures; her
science was her chief delight.” She stood on the
platform and taught men, and believed it to be her
vocation. Was it not for this that she had toiled
during long years of overwork and study, whilst
concealing her real purpose under the threadbare
cloak of a feigned marriage?</p>

<p>She was a woman of genius with a man’s brain,
who had come into the world as an example and a
leader of all sister brains.</p>

<p>She was, and she was not! Sometimes she felt
that she was, and then again she did not. In her
latter years she disclaimed the whole of her former
life, and silence reigned among the aggrieved
sisterhood whenever her name was mentioned; if
these latter years had never been, they would have
sent the hat round in order to erect a monument
in her memory. But that became impossible;
silence was best.</p>

<p>She was a woman. She was a woman in spite
of all—in spite of a feigned marriage which lasted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
nearly ten years, in spite of a widowhood which
lasted just as long, in spite of her Doctor’s degree
and the Professorship of Mathematics and the <i>Prix
Bordin</i>—she was a woman still; not merely a
lady, but an unhappy, injured little woman, running
through the woods with a wailing cry for her
husband.</p>

<p>She was far more of a woman than those luxurious,
prattling, sweatmeat-eating young ladies
whose languid movements lead us to suppose that
they have only just got out of bed; she was more
of a woman than the great majority of wives,
whose sole occupation it is to increase the world,
and to obliterate themselves in so doing.</p>

<p>She, who never charmed any man, was more of
a woman than the charmers who turn love into a
vocation. She was a new kind of woman, understood
by no one, because she was new; she did
not even understand herself, and made mistakes
for which she was less to blame than the spirit
of the age, by whose lash she was driven. And
when she became free at last, it was too late to
map out a future of her own.</p>

<p>Who knows whether it would have been better
for her had she been free from the first? A woman
has no destiny of her own; she cannot have one,
because she cannot exist alone. Neither can she
become a destiny, except indirectly, and through
the man. The more womanly she is, and the more
richly endowed, all the more surely will her destiny
be shaped by the man who takes her to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
his wife. If then, even in the case of the average
woman, everything depends upon the man whom
she marries, how much more true must this be in
the case of the woman of genius, in whom not
only her womanhood, but also her genius, needs
calling to life by the embrace of a man. And
if even the average woman cannot attain to the
full consciousness of her womanhood without man,
how much less can the woman of genius, in
whom sex is the actual root of her being, and
the source from whence she derives her talent
and her <i>ego</i>. If her womanhood remains unawakened,
then however promising the beginning may
be, her life will be nothing more than a gradual
decay, and the stronger her vitality, the more
terrible will the death-struggle be.</p>

<p>That was Sonia’s life. No man took her in
his arms and awoke the whole harmony of her
being. She became a mother and also a wife,
but she never learned what it is to love and be
loved again.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I write, the air is filled with a sweet penetrating
fragrance, which comes from a tuberose,
placed near me on the window-sill. The narrow
stalk seems scarcely strong enough to support its
thick, knob-like head with the withered buds and
sickly, onion-shaped leaves. A tuberose is a poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
unshapely thing at the best of times, but this
plant is unhealthy because it has lived too long
as an ornament in a dark corner of the room under
the chandeliers, among albums and photographs.
It was dying visibly, decaying at the roots, and
there was no help for it. Of course it was a rare
flower, but it grew uglier from day to day.</p>

<p>They put it on the window-sill, where there
was just room for one plant more, and a pot of
mignonette was fetched out of the kitchen garden,
attired in an artistic ruffle of green silk
paper, and placed under the chandelier in its
stead. It fulfilled its duty well, and seemed to
thrive admirably among the albums, visiting-cards,
and photographs. Nobody looked after the tuberose
on the window-sill until it suddenly reminded
them of its existence by a strong smell, and even
then they only cast a hasty glance and noticed
how sickly it looked. When I examined it more
closely, I discovered three blossoms in full flower,
and quite healthy; the stem was bent forward, and
the blossoms were pressing against the window-pane,
doing their best to catch the rays of the
sun as long as the short autumn day lasted. It
thrust forth its dying blossoms and renewed itself
now that the great warmer of life was shining
on, and embracing it.</p>

<p>To me this flower is an emblem of Sonia
Kovalevsky.</p>

<p>She was a rare, strange being in this world
of mignonette pots and trivialities. Everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
about her was out of proportion, from her thin
little body, with its large head, to the sweet fragrance
of her genius. She, too, stood in the
place of honor under the chandelier, among
fashionable poets and thinkers who wrote and
thought in accordance with the spirit of the age;
and she, too, sickened, as though she desired
something better, and the nervous blossoms which
her mind thrust forth grew more and more
withered, and the thin stem which carried her
stretched more and more towards the greater
warmer of life, which shines upon and embraces
the just and the unjust,—only not her, only not
her!</p>

<p>What was the reason? Why did she get none
of that love which is rained down upon the most
insignificant women in so lavish a manner by
impetuous mankind?</p>

<p>“She was not in the least pretty, that is it,”
reply her several women admirers.</p>

<p>But we women know well that it is not the
prettiest women who are the most loved, and
that, on the contrary, the most ardent love always
falls to the share of those in whom men have
something to excuse. Barbey d’Aurevilly, the
greatest women’s poet, has told us so in his immortal
lines.</p>

<p>“She was too old,—that is to say, she aged too
early,”—say her women admirers, still anxious
to find an explanation.</p>

<p>But that is ridiculous. Sonia Kovalevsky died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
at the age of forty, and that is the age when a
Parisian <i>grande mondaine</i> is at the height of her
popularity; and as for aging early—! A woman
of genius does not grow old as quickly as a teacher
in a girl’s school, and the fading tuberose which
thrusts forth fresh blossoms has a far sweeter and
more penetrating fragrance than her white knob-headed
sisters.</p>

<p>“She asked too much,” asserts Fru Anne Charlotte
Edgren-Leffler, Duchess of Cajanello, who
was of the same age as Sonia, and married at the
time when she died; and her entire book on Sonia
is founded on the one argument, that she asked
too much of love.</p>

<p>But how is it possible? Does not experience
teach us that it is just the women who ask most
who receive most? Always make fresh claims,—that
is the motto of the majority of ladies in
society, and with this solid principle to start from
they have none of them failed.</p>

<p>“She had everything that a human being can
desire,” said that worthy writer, Jonas Lie, in
an after-dinner speech. “She had genius, fame,
position, liberty, and she took the lead in the
education of humanity. But when she had all
this it seemed to her as nothing; she stretched
out her hand like a little girl, and said, ‘Oh, do
but give me also this orange.’”</p>

<p>It was kindly said, and also very true. Father
Lie was the only person who understood Sonia,
and saw that she remained a little girl all her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
life,—a woman who never reached her maturity.
But, tell me, dear Father Lie, do you consider
love to be worth no more than an orange?</p>

<p>No, these explanations will never satisfy us;
they are far too shallow and simple. The true
reason lies deeper; it is more a symptom of the
time in which she lived than those who knew her
will allow. Even so friendly and intelligent an
exponent as Ellen Key, her second biographer,
does not seem to be aware of the fact that,
although Sonia is a typical woman of her time,—typical
of the more earnest upholders of women’s
rights, and the representative of the highest intellectual
accomplishments to which women have
attained,—she is also typical of that which the
woman of this century loses in the struggle, and
of that in which the woman of the future will be
the gainer.</p>

<p>If Sonia failed to please,—she whose personal
charm was so great, whose vivacity was so prepossessing,
as all who knew her declared that it
was; if she failed where so many lesser women
have succeeded, her failure was entirely due to
her ignorance of the art of flirtation,—an art
which is as old as sex, and to which men have
been accustomed since the world began. Even
the most refined, the most highly-developed men,
are not geniuses in this matter, where everything
has always been most carefully arranged for them.
And if they did not fall in love with Sonia, it
was due to a kind of purity with which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
unconsciously regarded the preliminaries of love,—a
kind of nobility which existed in her more
modern nature, and a lack of the ancient instinct
which had been a lost heritage to her.</p>

<p>Sonia belonged to a class of women who have
only been produced in the latter half of our century,
but in such large numbers that it is they
who have determined the modern type. We
cannot help hoping that they are but transitory,
so greatly do their assumptions seem opposed to
their sex, and yet they are formed of the best
material that the age supplies. They are the
women who object to begin life by fulfilling their
destinies as women, and who consider that they
have duties of greater importance than that of
becoming wives and mothers; they are the
“clever” daughters of the middle-class families,
who, as governesses and teachers, swarm in every
country in Europe. The popular opinion about
them is that they do not want to marry; and as
that, by the majority of men, is interpreted to
mean that they are no good as wives, they turn
to the herd of geese who are driven yearly to the
market, and who go cackling to meet their fate.
And although the descendants of such fathers
and such mothers present a very small amount of
intelligence capable of development, yet it is
they who form the majority, and the majority is
always right. Formerly, it was people’s sole
object to get their daughters married, clever and
stupid alike; it was an understood thing. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
nowadays, the ones with “good heads” are set
apart to lead celibate lives, while those who are
“hard of understanding” are brought into the
marriage market. This method of distribution
has already become one of the first principles of
middle-class economy. The daughters who are
considered capable of providing for themselves
are given a good education, accompanied by
numerous hints as to the large sums which their
parents have spent on them; while, together
with the inevitable marriage portion, every effort
is made to find husbands for the others with as
little delay as possible. The first named are
“the clever women,” but the latter make “the
best wives;” and man’s sense of justice in the
distribution of the good things of this life has
fixed a stern practical barrier between these two
classes.</p>

<p>The intellectual women themselves were originally
to blame for raising a distinction which is
so essentially characteristic of our time. They
were the first to separate themselves, and to force
the narrow-minded <i>bourgeois</i> to entertain other
than the ordinary ideas concerning women. They
thrust aside the dishes which were spread for
them on life’s table, and grasped at others which
had hitherto been considered the sole property of
men, such as smoking and drinking. And when
it appeared that they were really able to pass
examinations and smoke cigarettes, without suffering
any apparent harm from either, the spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
of equality, so popular at the present time, was
quick to recognize a proof of the equality between
man and wife, and to proclaim the equal rights of
both, as well as the equality of the brain. They
did not mention the other human ingredient,
which could never be either equal or identical,
because it is always inconvenient to go to the
root of a thing, and the arguments of this materialistic
century are too superficial ever to go
below the surface.</p>

<p>Can it be true that the talented woman has
actually forgotten that destiny intended her to be
a woman, and bound her by eternal laws? Can
it be true that the best women have an unnatural
desire to be half men, and that they would prefer
to shirk the duties of motherhood? A woman’s
stupidity would not suffice to account for such
an interpretation; it needs all a man’s thick-headedness;
and yet there is no doubt that that
is, to a great extent, the popular view of the case.
The women whose intellectual abilities are above
the average are often those who lay themselves
open to the reproach that they have abandoned
their sex; and yet, strange to say, some of them
have attained to mature womanhood at an exceedingly
early age. Sonia, who was <i>par préférence</i>
the woman of genius of this century, was only
nine years old when she flew into a passion of
jealousy, caused by a little girl who was sitting
on the knees of her handsome young uncle. She
bit him in the arm till it bled, merely because she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
believed that he liked the child better than herself;
that this was something more than mere
childish naughtiness, is shown by the fact that
her feelings towards her uncle were so changed
that from that moment she felt disillusioned, and
treated him with coldness.</p>

<p>Disillusioned! Even in their childhood these
women have a strong, though indistinct, consciousness
of their own worth as compared to
ordinary women. They are always on the watch,
and they have a good memory. Unlike ordinary
young girls, they do not fall in love with mere
outward qualities, nor with the first man who
happens to cross their path. They wish to marry
some one superior to themselves, and they do not
mistake a passing passion for love. Then when
the first years of adolescence with their hot
impulses are past, and a temporary calm sets in,
they experience a new desire, which is that they
may enter into the full possession of their own
being before beginning to raise a new generation.
Physical maturity, which has hitherto been considered
sufficient, has placed the need for intellectual
and psychical maturity in the shade. They
want to be grown-up in mind and soul before
entering on life; they do not wish to remain
children always; they want to develop all their
capabilities,—and this longing for individuality,
for which the road has not yet been made clear,
nearly always leads them astray into the wilderness
of study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>This is certainly the case when they are urged
on, as Sonia Kovalevsky was, by a remarkable
talent. She was not even obliged to follow the
usual weary path of study; richly endowed and
favorably situated as she was, she discovered a
more direct way than is possible to the majority
of girl students. Few have been able to begin
as she did at the age of seventeen, under the protection
of a devoted husband, and under the
guidance of learned men, who took a personal
interest in her welfare. Few have finished at
the age of twenty-four, and have been loaded
with distinctions while in the full bloom of their
youth, able to stand on the threshold of a rich,
full life, while fortune bid them take and choose
whatever they might wish.</p>

<p>Yet these were but hollow joys that were
offered to her. Those six years of protracted
study left her weak in body and soul, and so weary
that she needed a long period of idle vegetation,
and she felt an aversion from the very studies in
which she had accomplished so much. Sonia had
overworked herself in the way that most girls overwork
themselves in their examinations, whether
it be for the university or as teachers; they work
on with persistent diligence, looking neither to
the right nor to the left, but going straight ahead
as though they were the victims of hypnotic suggestion,
with all their energies paralyzed except
one solitary organ,—the memory. A man never
does this; he interrupts his studies with social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
recreations and by means of a system of hygiene,
applied alike to body and soul, from which a
woman is excluded, no less on account of her
womanly susceptibility than owing to conventional
views. During this period of nervous tension,
her sex is silent; or if it shows itself at all,
it does so only in general irritability.</p>

<p>This was the case with Sonia; but until she
became thoroughly engrossed in her work at
Weierstrass’s, Valdemar Kovalevsky had a great
deal to endure. It was not enough for her that
she made him run all kinds of messages, which
a servant could have done as well, but she was
always going to see him in his bachelor apartments,
and planning little excursions, and she
was never satisfied unless she could have him to
herself. Valdemar did not understand her. He
had willingly consented to become the husband,
in name only, of an undeveloped little girl, and
be respected the distorted ideas of the time,
which had got firmly fixed into this same little
girl’s head. It is very natural that Sonia should
not have understood the situation; it was not her
business to do so, it was his. But she was always
irritable and vexed after a <i>tête-à-tête</i> of any length
with him, and long after his death she used scornfully
to say: “He could get on capitally without
me. If he had his cigarettes, his cup of tea, and
a book, it was all that he required.”</p>

<p>Valdemar Kovalevsky, the translator of Brehm’s
Birds and other popular scientific works into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Russian, appears to have belonged to that portion
of the male sex who are called “paragons.”
He drudged diligently, had few wants,
always did what was right, and never gave in.
But he was in no way suited to Sonia, and
the fact of his having agreed to her proposal
proves it. After he had gone to Jena to escape
from her wilful squandering of his time, an
estrangement took place between them, and at
Berlin she seems to have behaved as though she
were ashamed of him. She was living then, as
we have seen, with a girl friend who was a fellow-student
of hers; and although she let Valdemar
fetch her from Weierstrass’s, she introduced him
to no one, and did not let it appear that he was
her husband. Afterwards, when she had finished
her studies and undergone a long period of enforced
idleness at the time when her nerves were
shaken by her father’s death, she clung so closely
to him that a little warmth came into his stolid
nature. But, naturally enough, neither her affection
nor the birth of a daughter could change his
nature, and even during the short time when they
were together at St. Petersburg he allowed an
intriguing swindler to come between them. Repulsed,
dissatisfied, and saddened, Sonia went to
Paris.</p>

<p>She wished to stand alone, and the only way
in which this was possible was to turn her studies
to account and to work for her own bread. She
had given up the wish to be a learned woman; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
wanted to be a wife, to be loved and made happy;
she had done her best, but it had turned out a
failure. It was just about this time that she
received an invitation through Professor Mittag-Leffler
to be teacher under him in the new high
school at Stockholm. He was Fru Leffler’s
brother, and a pupil of Weierstrass’s. Sonia
gratefully consented, but a fine ear detects a
peculiar undertone in the letters with which she
responded.</p>

<p>In Stockholm she did not show the womanly
side of her character to any one, least of all to
Professor Mittag-Leffler, with whom she was on
terms of the most cordial friendship. She found
herself in very uncongenial surroundings, in a
society where life was conducted on the strictest
utilitarian principles. It was the worst time of
her life, and one from which her impressionable
nature never entirely recovered.</p>

<p>Before this, however, while she was in Paris,
she had an experience which was truly characteristic
of her.</p>

<p>In the interval which elapsed between her
separation from her husband and his death, she
made the acquaintance of a young Pole, who was,
as Fru Leffler tells us, “a revolutionary, a mathematician,
a poet, with a soul aglow with enthusiasm
like her own. It was the first time that
she had met any one who really understood her,
who shared her varying moods, and sympathized
with all her thoughts and dreams as he did.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
They were nearly always together, and the short
hours when they were apart were spent in writing
long effusions to each other. They were wild
about the idea that human beings were created
in couples, and that men and women are only
half beings until they have found their other
half....” He was with her by night and day,
for he could seldom make up his mind to go
before two o’clock in the morning, when he would
climb over the garden wall, quite regardless of
what people would think. Fru Leffler, who had
passed the twenty years of her first marriage in
the outer courts of the temple of Hymen, and only
learned to know love and the joys of motherhood
at the age of forty, alludes to this incident as
being “very curious.” Because the two did nothing
but talk, talk, talk, revelling in each other’s
conversation, and assuring one another that they
“could never be united,” because “he was going
to keep himself pure” for the girl who was
wandering about on this or another planet, and
keeping herself for him.</p>

<p>One would imagine that this was childish nonsense,
and that a woman of Sonia’s intelligence,
with her position in the world, must surely have
sent the silly boy about his business as soon as
he began to talk in this strain. But no! her soul
melted into his “like two flames which unite in
one common glow.” And there they sat, nervous
and excited, unable to tear themselves away
from each other, flinging endless chains of words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
backwards and forwards across the table, and
pouring streams of witticism into Danaïde’s barrel,
talking as though life depended upon it, for
there must not be any pauses,—anything was
better than those dreadful pauses, when one seems
to hear nothing but the beating of one’s own
pulse, when shy eyes meet another’s, and cold
damp hands seek for a corner in which to hide
themselves.</p>

<p>We do not know what pleasure the “pure”
young mathematician, poet, and Pole could find
in this, nor do we care; we leave that to those
who take an interest in the ebullitions of model
young men of his class. The only part of the
situation with which we are concerned is Sonia
herself, and she is extremely interesting. In
the first place, such a situation as this is never
brought about by the man, or, at any rate, not
more than once; and a woman cannot be entrapped
into it against her will. The silliest
schoolgirl knows how to get rid of a troublesome
man when she wishes; they all do it brilliantly.
It is quite a different matter when she wants him
to stay, when she is trembling with excitement,
and dreads the moment when he will rise to go.
Who is not well acquainted with the situation,
especially when the parties concerned are an
intelligent girl and a dilettante man? In this
case Sonia was the intelligent girl. Her behavior
was that of a young lady who is painfully conscious
of her own inexperience. A married<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
woman who knows what love is can be calm in
the presence of the warmest passion. She knows
so well the path which leads astray that she no
longer fears the unknown, and uncertainty has
no attraction for her.</p>

<p>I shall probably be told that it is the married
women who enjoy these situations most. That
is quite true. There are many married women
for whom marriage is neither <i>l’amour goût</i>, nor
<i>l’amour passion</i>, nor <i>l’amour savant</i>, nor yet any
other love, but a mere mechanical transaction.
If the husband is indifferent he cannot rouse his
wife’s love. Not motherhood, but the lover’s
kiss, awakes the Sleeping Beauty. And in the
Madonna’s immaculate conception the Church
has incarnated the virgin mother in a profound
symbol, which only needs a psychological interpretation
to make it applicable to thousands of
every-day cases.</p>

<p>Extraordinary though it may seem, Sonia was
on this occasion, as on many other occasions in
later life, a woman who experienced desire without
being in the least aware of it. She was like
a virgin mother who had borne a child without
knowing man’s love. Valdemar Kovalevsky, who
seems to me to have been incapable of filling any
position in life, was certainly not the husband for
Sonia, who, as a woman of genius, cannot be
judged by the same standard as ordinary women.
The average man is certainly not suited to be
the husband of an exceptional woman with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
original mind and sensitive temperament. But
they do not know themselves; for it is in the
nature of great talents to remain hidden from
their owners, who have a long way to go before
they attain to the full realization of their own
powers. Only those geniuses whose talents have
little or no connection with their individuality
are sufficiently alive to their own claims not to
fall short in life, and not to allow themselves to
be hindered by any natural modesty.</p>

<p>Modesty comes only too naturally to great
geniuses. They are conscious of being different
from other people, yet when they are compelled
to come forward they only do so under protest,
and then beg every one’s pardon. The richest
natures are the least conscious of their own
powers; they are ashamed because they think
that they are offering a copper, when in reality
they are giving away kingdoms. This is doubly
true of the woman who knows nothing of her
own powers until the man comes to reveal them
to her.</p>

<p>It was the same with Sonia. She was always
giving away handfuls,—her mind, her learning,
her social gifts; she placed them all at the disposal
of others; yet when she, who felt the eternal
loneliness which accompanies genius, asked
for the entire affection of another, she was told
that she asked too much. There can be no agreement
between that which genius has the right to
ask, and mediocrity the power to give. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
not a very strong affection that she had for the
young Pole, and, such as it was, it did but intensify
her sense of loneliness. It was at Paris that
she received the news of her husband’s suicide;
and she, who suffered so acutely from every successive
death in her family, seemed doomed to
receive one blow after another at the hand of
fate. She had scarcely recovered from a nervous
fever, resulting from the shock, when she was
called to Stockholm by the supporters of women’s
rights,—to Stockholm, where her soul congealed,
her mind was unsatisfied, and where her body
was to die.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I shall</span> only give a hasty sketch of the years that
followed. Fru Leffler has given us a detailed
account of them in her book on Sonia, and Ellen
Key, in her life of Fru Leffler, has made the
crooked straight, and has filled in some of the
gaps. I shall merely touch upon this period for
the sake of those of my readers who are not
acquainted with either of the above-mentioned
works. These years were about the most lifeless,
and, psychologically speaking, the most
empty in Sonia’s life. She was called upon to
take part in a movement which from its commencement
was doomed to fail on account of its
narrow principles. The social circle was divided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
into two separate groups, one of which consisted
of ladies and dilettante youths, very excitable
and full of zeal for reform, but without a single
really superior man among them; the other was
of an essentially Swedish character, consisting
chiefly of men; the “better class” of women were
excluded, and drinking bouts, night revelling,
club life, song-singing, and easy-going friendship
was the rule. These included a few talented
people among their number, and expressed the
utmost contempt for the other group. For the
first time in her life Sonia was made to do
ordinary every-day work, and to exert herself
after the manner of a mere drudge, or a cart-horse,
for payment. Her position rendered her
dependent on the moral standard of a <i>clique</i>.
With the flexibility of her Russian nature, she
renounced the freedom to which she had been
accustomed, and devoted herself to her duties
as lecturer under a professor. This work soon
began to weary her to death. Mathematics
lost their charm now that the genius of old
Weierstrass was no longer there to elucidate
the problems, and to encourage her to do
that which women had hitherto been unable
to accomplish.</p>

<p>For some time she struggled on through thick
and thin, without however sinking low enough to
give her superiors no longer any cause to shake
their heads or to admonish her. Lively, witty,
and unassuming, the task of entertaining people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
at their social gatherings fell to her share, and
she bore the weight of it without a murmur,
until her wasted amiability resulted in an undue
familiarity in the circle of her admirers, of both
sexes, causing her much vexation. When the
first excitement of novelty was passed, she devoted
herself chiefly to her true but stolid friend,
Anne Charlotte Leffler. It was one of those
friendships which are getting to be very common
now that women are becoming intellectual; it
was not the result of any deep mutual sympathy,
nor was it formed out of the fulness of their lives,
but rather from the consciousness that there was
something lacking, as when two <i>minus</i> combine
in the attempt to form one <i>plus</i>. Then as soon
as the <i>plus</i> is there, all interest in one another,
and all mutual sympathy is a thing of the past,
as it proved in this case, when the Duke of
Cajanello appeared on Fru Leffler’s horizon, and
she afterwards, in the honeymoon of her happiness,
possibly with the best of intentions, but
with very little tact or sympathy, wrote her
obituary book on Sonia.</p>

<p>One of the results of this friendship was a
series of unsuccessful literary attempts, for which
the material was provided by Sonia, and dramatized
by Fru Leffler. The latter tried to put
Sonia’s psychological, intuitive experiences into
a realistic shape, and the result was, as might be
expected, a failure. Sonia was a mystic, whose
whole being was one indistinct longing, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
beginning and without end; Fru Leffler was an
enlightened woman, daughter of a college rector,
“who worked incessantly at her own development.”
Even while the work of collaboration
was in progress, a slight friction began to make
itself felt between the two friends. Fru Leffler
was vexed at having, as she expressed it, “repudiated
her own child” in the story called “Round
about Marriage,” in which she attempted to
describe the lives of women who remain unmarried.
The storms raised by Sonia’s vivid imagination
oppressed her, and imported a foreign
element into her sober style, resulting in long
padded novels, which were too ambitious, and
had a false ring about them. Her influence on
Sonia produced the opposite result. Sonia saw
that Fru Leffler was less talented than she had
supposed, and this made her place greater confidence
in her own merits as an author. She
began to write a story of her own youth, called
“The Sisters Rajevsky,” which we have already
mentioned, followed by a story about the so-called
Nihilists, “Vera Barantzova;” both these
books displayed a wider experience, and contained
the promise of greater things than any of
the contemporaneous literature by women, but
they did not receive the recognition which they
deserved, because nobody understood the characters
which she depicted.</p>

<p>Up till now there has been a fundamental
error in all the attempts made to understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Sonia Kovalevsky, and the fault is chiefly due to
Fru Leffler, who wrote of her from the following
standpoint:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“I am great and you are great,</div>
<div class="verse">We are both equally great.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Sonia and her biographer are by no means
“equally great.” To compare Fru Leffler to
Sonia is like comparing a nine days’ wonder
to an eternal phenomenon. One is an ordinary
woman with a carefully cultivated talent,
while the other is one of those mysteries who,
from time to time, make their appearance in
the world, in whom nature seems to have overstepped
her boundaries, and who are created
to live lonely lives, to suffer and to die without
having ever attained the full possession of their
own being.</p>

<p>In the year 1888, at the age of thirty-eight,
Sonia learned for the first time to know the love
which is a woman’s destiny. M. K. was a great,
heavy Russian boyar, who had been a professor,
but was dismissed on account of his free-thinking
views. He was a dissipated man and rich,
and had spent his time in travelling since he left
Russia. He was no longer young, like the Duke
of Cajanello. A few years older than Sonia, he
was one of those complacent, self-centred characters
who have never known what it is to long
for sympathy, who are totally devoid of ideals,
and are not given to vain illusions. Comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
speaking, an older woman always has a
better chance with a man younger than herself,
and there was nothing very surprising in the love
which the young and insignificant Duke bestowed
on Fru Leffler. With Sonia it was quite different.
The boyar had already enjoyed as many of
the good things of this world as he desired; he
was both practical and sceptical, the kind of man
whom women think attractive, and who boast that
they understand women. I am not at liberty to
mention his name, as he is still alive and enjoys
good health. He was interested in Sonia, as
much as he was capable of being interested in
any one, because she was a compatriot to be
proud of, and he also liked her because she was
good company, but Sonia never acquired all the
power over him which she should have had. He
was not like a susceptible young man who is
influenced by the first woman who has really
given him the full passion of her love. The
long-repressed love which was now lavished upon
him by the woman who was no longer young had
none of the surprise of novelty in it, not even
the unexpected treasure of flattered vanity. He
accepted it calmly, and never for a moment did
he allow it to interfere with his mode of life.
Even though he had no wife, his bachelor’s existence
had never lacked the companionship of
women. Sonia should occupy the position of
wife, but an ardent lover it was no longer in his
power to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>The conflict points plainly to a double rupture
between them,—the one internal and the other
external,—both brought about by the spirit of
the age.</p>

<p>Sonia’s womanhood had awakened in her the
first time they met, and he became her first love.
She loved him as a young girl loves, with a
trembling and ungovernable joy at finding all
that had hitherto been hidden in herself; she
rejoiced in the knowledge that he was there, that
she would see him again to-morrow as she had
seen him to-day, that she could touch him, hold
him with her hands. She lived only when she
saw him; her senses were dulled when he was
no longer there. It was then that Stockholm
became thoroughly hateful to her; it seemed to
hold her fast in its clutches, to crush the woman
in her, and to deprive her of her nationality.
He represented the South,—the great world of
intellect and freedom; but above all else, he was
home, he was Russia! He was the emblem of
her native land; he had come speaking the language
in which her nurse had sung to her, in
which her father and sister and all the loved and
lost had spoken to her; he was her hearth and
home in the dreary world. But more than all
this, he was the only man capable of arousing
her love.</p>

<p>But if she took a short holiday and followed
him to Paris and Italy, his cold greeting was
sure to chill her inmost being, and instead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the comfort which she had hoped to find in his
love and sympathy, she was thrown back upon
herself, more miserable and disappointed than
before.</p>

<p>Her spirits were beginning to give way. It
seemed as though the world were growing empty
around her and the darkness deepening, while
she stood in the midst of it all, alone and unprotected.
But what drove matters to a climax was
that their most intimate daily intercourse took
place just at the time when she was in Paris
working hard, and sitting up at nights. When
she was awarded the <i>Prix Bordin</i> on Christmas
Eve, 1888, in the presence of the greatest French
mathematicians, she forgot that she was a European
celebrity, whose name would endure forever
and be numbered among the women who had outstripped
all others; she was only conscious of
being an overworked woman, suffering from one
of those nervous illnesses when white seems
turned to black, joy to sorrow,—enduring the
unutterable misery caused by mental and physical
exhaustion, when the night brings no rest to
the tortured nerves. As is always the case with
productive natures under like circumstances, her
passions were at their highest pitch, and she
needed sympathy from without to give relief. It
was then that she received an offer of marriage
from the man whom she loved; but she was too
well aware of the gulf which lay between his
gentlemanly bearing and her devouring passion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
to accept it, and determined that since she could
not have all she would have nothing. It may be
that she was haunted by the recollection of her
first marriage, or she may have been influenced
by the woman’s rights standpoint which weighs
as in a scale: For so and so many ounces of love,
I must have so and so many ounces of love and
fidelity; and for so and so many yards of virtuous
behavior, I have a right to expect exactly the
same amount from him.</p>

<p>It happened, however, that the man in question
would not admit of such calculations, and
Sonia went back to Stockholm and her hated
university work with the painful knowledge of
“never having been all in all to anybody.” After
a time she began to realize that love is not a thing
which can be weighed and measured. She now
concentrated her strength in an attempt to free
herself from her work at Stockholm, which had
been turned into a life-long appointment since
she won the <i>Prix Bordin</i>; she longed to get away
from Sweden, where she felt very lonely, having
no one to whom she could confide her thoughts.
She had some hopes of being given an honorary
appointment as a member of the Imperial Russian
Academy, which would place her in a position of
pecuniary independence, with the liberty to reside
where she pleased. But when she returned to
her work at Stockholm in the beginning of the
year 1891, after a trip to Italy in company with
the man whom she loved, it was with the conviction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
grown stronger than ever, of not being able
to put up with the loneliness and emptiness of
her existence any longer, and with the determination
of throwing everything aside and accepting
his proposal.</p>

<p>She came to this decision while suffering from
extreme weariness. Her Russian temperament
was very much opposed to the manner of her
life for the last few years. Her spirits, which
wavered between a state of exaltation and apathy,
were depressed by a regular routine of work and
social intercourse, and she was never allowed the
thorough rest which she so greatly needed. In
one year she lost all who were dear to her; and
though dissatisfied with her own life, she was
able to sympathize deeply with her beloved sister
Anjuta, whose proud dreams of youth were either
doomed to destruction, or else their fulfilment
was accompanied with disappointment, while she
herself was dying slowly, body and soul. Life
had dealt hardly with both these sisters. When
Sonia travelled home for the last time, after exchanging
the warm, cheerful South for the cold,
dismal North, she broke down altogether. Alone
and over-tired as she always was on these innumerable
journeys, which were only undertaken in
order to cure her nervous restlessness, her spirits
were no longer able to encounter the discomforts
of travel, and she gave way. The perpetual
changes, whether in rain, wind, or snow, accompanied
by all the small annoyances, such as getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
money changed, and finding no porters,
overpowered her, and for a short time life seemed
to have lost all its value. With an utter disregard
for consequences, she exposed herself to all
winds and weathers, and arrived ill at Stockholm,
where her course of lectures was to begin immediately.
A heavy cold ensued, accompanied by
an attack of fever; and so great was her longing
for fresh air, that she ran out into the street on
a raw February day in a light dress and thin
shoes.</p>

<p>Her illness was short; she died a couple of
days after it began. Two friends watched beside
her, and she thanked them warmly for the care
they took of her,—thanked them as only strangers
are thanked. They had gone home to rest before
the death-struggle began, and there was no one
with her but a strange nurse, who had just
arrived. She died alone, as she had lived,—died,
and was buried in the land where she had
not wished to live, and where her best strength
had been spent.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is yet another picture behind the one
depicted in these pages. It is large, dark, and
mysterious, like a reflection in the water; we
see it, but it melts away each time we try to
grasp it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>When we know the story of a person’s life,
and are acquainted with their surroundings and
the conditions under which they have been
brought up; when we have been told about their
sufferings, and the illness of which they died, we
imagine that we know all about them, and are
able to form a more or less correct portrait of
them in our mind’s eye, and we even think that
we are in a position to judge of their life and
character. There is scarcely any one whose life
is less veiled to the public gaze than Sonia
Kovalevsky’s. She was very frank and communicative,
and took quite a psychological interest in
her own character; she had nothing to conceal,
and was known by a large number of people
throughout Europe. She lived her life before
the eyes of the public, and died of inflammation
of the lungs, brought on by an attack of
influenza.</p>

<p>Such was Sonia Kovalevsky’s life as depicted
by Fru Leffler, in a manner which reveals a very
limited comprehension of her subject; the chief
thing missing is the likeness to Sonia.</p>

<p>This sketch was afterwards corrected and completed
with great sympathy and delicacy by Ellen
Key, but she has also failed to catch the likeness
of Sonia Kovalevsky.</p>

<p>And mine—written as it is with the full consciousness
of being better able to understand
her than either of these two, partly on account of
the impressions left by my own half-Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
childhood; partly, too, because in some ways
my temperament resembles hers—my sketch,
although it is an analysis of her life, is not
Sonia Kovalevsky.</p>

<p>She is still standing there, supernaturally
great, like a shadow when the moon rises, which
seems to grow larger the longer one looks at it;
and as I write this, I feel as though she were as
near to me as a body that one knocks up against
in the dark. She comes and goes. Sometimes
she appears close beside me sitting on the flower-table,
a little bird-like figure, and I seem to
see her quite distinctly; then, as soon as I begin
to realize her presence, she has gone. And I
ask myself,—Who is she? I do not know; she
did not know it herself. She lived, it is true,
but she never lived her own, real, individual
life.</p>

<p>She remains there still,—a form which came
out of the darkness and went back into the same.
She was a thorough child of the age in every
little characteristic of her aimless life; she was
a woman of this century, or rather, she was what
this century forces a woman to be,—a genius for
nothing, a woman for nothing, ever struggling
along a road which leads to nowhere, and fainting
on the way as she strives to attain a distant
mirage. Tired to death, and yet afraid to die,
she died because the instinct for self-preservation
forsook her for the space of a single instant; died
only to be buried under a pile of obituary notices,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
and forgotten for the next novelty. But behind
them all she stands, an immortal personality, hot
and volcanic as the world’s centre, a thorough
woman, yet more than a woman. Her brain rose
superior to sex, and learned to think independently,
only to be dragged down again and made
subservient to sex; her soul was full of mysticism,
conscious of the Infinite existing in her
little body, and out of her little body again soaring
up towards the Infinite,—a one day’s superficial
consciousness which allowed itself to be
led astray by public opinion, yet possessing, all
the while, a sub-consciousness, which, poetically
viewed, clung fast to the eternal realities in her
womanly frame, and would not let them rise to
the brain, which, freed from the body, floated in
empty space. Hers was a queenly mind, feeding
a hundred beggars at her board,—giving to all,
but confiding in none.</p>

<p>Ellen Key once said to me: “When she shook
hands, you felt as if a little bird with a beating
heart had fluttered into your hand and out again.”
And another friend, Hilma Strandberg, a young
writer of great promise, whose after career belied
its commencement, said, after her first meeting
with Sonia, that she had felt as though the latter’s
glance had pierced her through and through, after
which she seemed to be dissecting her soul, bit
by bit, every bit vanishing into thin air; this
psychical experience was followed by such violent
bodily discomfort that she almost fainted, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
was only with the greatest difficulty that she
managed to get home.</p>

<p>Both these descriptions prove that Sonia’s
hands and eyes were the most striking part of her
personality. Many anecdotes are told about her
penetrating glance, but this is the only one which
mentions her hands, although it is true that Fru
Leffler remarked that they were very much disfigured
by veins. But this one is sufficient to
complete a picture of her which I remember to
have seen: she has a slender little child’s body,
and her hands are the hands of a child, with
nervous, crooked little fingers, anxiously bent
inwards; and in one hand she clasps a book, with
such visible effort that it makes one’s heart ache
to look at her.</p>

<p>The hands often afford better material for
psychological study than the face, and they give
a deeper and more truthful insight into the character
because they are less under control. There
are people with fine, clever faces, whose hands are
like sausages,—fleshy and veinless, with thick
stumpy fingers which warn us to beware of the
animated mask. And there are round, warm,
sensuous faces, with full, almost thick lips, which
are obviously contradicted by pale, blue-veined,
sickly-looking hands. The momentary amount
of intellectual power which a person has at his
disposal can change the face, but the hands are
of a more physical nature, and their speech is a
more physical one. Sonia’s face was lit up by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
the soul in her eyes, which bore witness to the
intense interest which she took in everything
that was going on around her; but the weak,
nervous, trembling little hands told of the unsatisfied,
helpless child, who was never to attain the
full development of her womanhood.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Last</span> year there was a book published in London
with the extraordinary title of “Keynotes.”
Three thousand copies were sold in the course of
a few months, and the unknown author became
a celebrity. Soon afterwards the portrait of a
lady appeared in “The Sketch.” She had a
small, delicate face, with a pained and rather
tired expression, and a curious, questioning look
in the eyes; it was an attractive face, very gentle
and womanly, and yet there was something disillusioned
and unsatisfied about it. This lady
wrote under the pseudonym of George Egerton,
and “Keynotes” was her first book.</p>

<p>It was a strange book! too good a book to
become famous all at once. It burst upon the
world like the opening buds in spring, like the
cherry blossom after the first cold shower of rain.
What can have made this book so popular in the
England of to-day, which is as totally devoid of
all true literature as Germany itself? Was it
only the writer’s strong individuality, which each
successive page impressed upon the reader’s
nerves more vividly and more painfully than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
last? The reader, did I say? Yes, but not the
male reader. There are very few men who have
a sufficiently keen appreciation for a woman’s
feelings to be able to put their own minds and
souls into the swing of her confession, and to
accord it their full sympathy. Yet there are
such men. We may perhaps come across two or
three of them in a lifetime, but they disappear
from our sight, as we do from theirs. And they
are not readers. Their sympathy is of a deeper,
more personal character, and as far as the success
of a book is concerned, it need not be taken into
consideration at all.</p>

<p>“Keynotes” is not addressed to men, and it
will not please them. It is not written in the
style adopted by the other women Georges,—George
Sand and George Eliot,—who wrote from
a man’s point of view, with the solemnity of a
clergyman or the libertinism of a drawing-room
hero. There is nothing of the man in this book,
and no attempt is made to imitate him, even in
the style, which springs backwards and forwards
as restlessly as a nervous little woman at her
toilet, when her hair will not curl and her stay-lace
breaks. Neither is it a book which favors
men; it is a book written against them, a book
for our private use.</p>

<p>There have been such books before; old-maid
literature is a lucrative branch of industry, both
in England and Germany (the two most unliterary
countries in Europe), and that is probably the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
reason why the majority of authoresses write as
though they were old maids. But there are no
signs of girlish prudery in “Keynotes;” it is a
liberal book, indiscreet in respect of the intimacies
of married life, and entirely without
respect for the husband; it is a book with claws
and teeth ready to scratch and bite when the
occasion offers,—not the book of a woman who
married for the sake of a livelihood, but the book
of a devoted wife, who would be inseparable from
her husband if only he were not so tiresome, and
dull, and stupid, such a thorough man, insufferable
at times, and yet indispensable as the husband
always is to the wife.</p>

<p>And it is the book of a gentlewoman!</p>

<p>We have had tell-tale women before, but Heaven
preserve us! Fru Skram is a man in petticoats;
she speaks her mind plainly enough,—rather too
plainly to suit my taste. “Gyp,” a distinguished
Frenchwoman, has written “Autour du Mariage,”
and she cannot be said to mince matters either.
But here we have something quite different;
something which does not in the least resemble
Gyp’s frivolous worldliness or Amalie Skram’s
coarseness. Mrs. Egerton would shudder at the
thought of washing dirty linen in public, and she
could not, even if she were to force herself, treat
the relationship between husband and wife with
cynical irony, and she does not force herself in
the very least.</p>

<p>She writes as she really is, because she cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
do otherwise. She has had an excellent education,
and is a lady with refined tastes, with something
of that innocence of the grown woman
which is almost more touching than a girl’s
innocence, because it proves how little of his
knowledge of life in general, and his sex in particular,
the Teutonic husband confides to his
wife. She stands watching him,—an eating,
loving, smoking organism. Heavens! how wearisome!
So loved, and yet so wearisome! It is
unbearable! And she retreats into herself, and
realizes that she is a woman.</p>

<p>It is almost universal amongst women, especially
Germans, that they do not take man as
seriously as he likes to imagine. They think
him comical,—not only when they are married
to him, but even before that, when they are in
love with him. Men have no idea what a comical
appearance they present, not only as individuals,
but as a race. The comic part about a man is
that he is so different from women, and that is
just what he is proudest of. The more refined
and fragile a woman is, the more ridiculous she
is likely to find the clumsy great creature who
takes such a roundabout way to gain his comical
ends.</p>

<p>To young girls especially man offers a perpetual
excuse for a laugh, and a secret shudder.
When men find a group of women laughing among
themselves, they never suspect that it is they who
are the cause of it. And that again is so comic!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
The better a man is, the more he is in earnest
when he makes his pathetic appeal for a great
love; and woman, who takes a special delight in
playing a little false, even when there is no
necessity, becomes as earnest and solemn as he,
when all the time she is only making fun of
him. A woman wants amusement, wants change;
a monotonous existence drives her to despair,
whereas a man thrives on monotony, and the
cleverer he is the more he wishes to retire into
himself, that he may draw upon his own resources;
a clever woman needs variety, that she may
take her impressions from without.</p>

<p>... The early blossoms of the cherry-tree
shudder beneath the cold rain which has burst
their scales; this shudder is the deepest vibration
in Mrs. Egerton’s book. What is the subject?
A little woman in every imaginable mood,
who is placed in all kinds of likely and unlikely
circumstances: in every story it is the same little
woman with a difference, the same little woman,
who is always loved by a big, clumsy, comic
man, who is now good and well-behaved, now
wild, drunk, and brutal; who sometimes ill-treats
her, sometimes fondles her, but never understands
what it is that he ill-treats and fondles.
And she sits like a true Englishwoman with her
fishing-rod, and while she is waiting for a bite,
“her thoughts go to other women she has known,
women good and bad, school friends, casual acquaintances,
women-workers,—joyless machines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
for grinding daily corn, unwilling maids grown
old in the endeavor to get settled, patient wives
who bear little ones to indifferent husbands until
they wear out,—a long array. She busies herself
with questioning. Have they, too, this thirst for
excitement, for change, this restless craving for
sun and love and motion? Stray words, half
confidences, glimpses through soul-chinks of suppressed
fires, actual outbreaks, domestic catastrophes,—how
the ghosts dance in the cells of
her memory! And she laughs—laughs softly to
herself because the denseness of man, his chivalrous
conservative devotion to the female idea he
has created, blinds him, perhaps happily, to the
problems of her complex nature, ... and well
it is that the workings of our hearts are closed
to them, that we are cunning enough or <i>great</i>
enough to seem to be what they would have us,
rather than be what we are. But few of them
have had the insight to find out the key to our
seeming contradictions,—the why a refined,
physically fragile woman will mate with a brute,
a mere male animal with primitive passions,
and love him; the why strength and beauty
appeal more often than the more subtly fine qualities
of mind or heart; the why women (and not
the innocent ones) will condone sins that men
find hard to forgive in their fellows. They have
all overlooked the eternal wildness, the untamed
primitive savage temperament that lurks in the
mildest, best woman. Deep in through ages of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
convention this primeval trait burns, an untamable
quantity that may be concealed, but is never
eradicated by culture,—the keynote of woman’s
witchcraft and woman’s strength.”</p>

<p>They are not stories which Mrs. Egerton tells
us. She does not care for telling stories. They
are keynotes which she strikes, and these keynotes
met with an extraordinary and most unexpected
response. They struck a sympathetic chord
in women, which found expression in a multitude
of letters, and also in the sale of the book. An
author can hope for no happier fate than to receive
letters which re-echo the tune that he has discovered
in his own soul. Those who have received
them know what pleasant feelings they call forth.
We often do not know where they come from, we
cannot answer them, nor should we wish to do so
if we could. They give us a sudden insight into
the hidden centre of a living soul, where we can
gaze into the secret, yearning life, which is never
lived in the sight of the world, but is generally
the best part of a person’s nature; we feel the
sympathetic clasp of a friendly hand, and our own
soul is filled with a thankfulness which will never
find expression in words. The dark world seems
filled with unknown friends, who surround us on
every side like bright stars in the night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Egerton had struck the fundamental chord
in woman’s nature, and her book was received
with applause by hundreds of women. The critic
said: “The woman in ‘Keynotes’ is an exceptional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
type, and we can only deal with her as
such.” “Good heavens! How stupid they are!”
laughed Mrs. Egerton. Numberless women wrote
to her, women whom she did not know, and whose
acquaintance she never made. “We are quite
ordinary, every-day sort of people,” they said;
“we lead trivial, unimportant lives; but there is
something in us which vibrates to your touch, for
we, too, are such as you describe.” “Keynotes”
took like wildfire.</p>

<p>There is nothing tangible in the book to which
it can be said to owe its significance. Notes are
not tangible. The point on which it differs from
all other well-known books by women is the intensity
of its awakened consciousness as woman.
It follows no pattern and is quite independent of
any previous work; it is simply full of a woman’s
individuality. It is not written on a large scale,
and it does not reveal a very expansive temperament.
But, such as it is, it possesses an amount
of nervous energy which carries us along with it,
and we must read every page carefully until the
last one is turned, not peep at the end to see what
is going to happen, as we do when reading a story
with a plot; we must read every page for its own
sake, if we would feel the power of its different
moods, varying from feverish haste to wearied
rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nearly</span> a year afterwards, a book was published in
Paris by Lemerre, called “Dilettantes.” Instead
of the author’s name there were three stars, but a
catalogue issued by a less illustrious publisher is
not so discreet. It mentions the bearer of a well-known
pseudonym as the author of the book; a
lady who first gained a reputation by translating
Hungarian folk songs into French, for which she
received an acknowledgment from the <i>Académie
Française</i>, and who afterwards introduced Scandinavian
authors to Paris, thereby deserving the
thanks of both countries. She has also made
herself a name in literary circles by her original
and clever criticisms. Those who are behind the
scenes know that the translator’s pseudonym and
the three stars conceal a lady who belongs to the
highest aristocracy of Austria, and who is herself
a “dilettante,” inasmuch as she writes without any
pecuniary object, and that, quite independent of
her public, she writes and translates what she
pleases. Her social position has placed her among
intellectual people; on her mother’s side she is
descended from one of the foremost families among
the Austrian nobility, and she has lived in Paris
from her childhood, where she has enjoyed the
society of the best authors, and acquired a French
style which, for richness, beauty, and grace, might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
well cause many an older French author to envy
her. It is in this French, which she finds more
pliable than the homely Viennese German, that
this curious book is written.</p>

<p>I search high and low for words in which to
describe the nature of this book, but in vain. It
is womanly to such an extent, and in such a peculiar
way, that we lack the words to express it in a
language which has not yet learned to distinguish
between the art of man and the art of woman in
the sphere of production. It has the same effect
upon us as Mrs. Egerton’s “Keynotes.”</p>

<p>The same reason which makes it difficult to
understand this Celtic woman with the English
pseudonym, makes it equally difficult to draw an intelligible
picture of this French-writing Austrian,
with the Polish and Hungarian blood mingled in
her veins. But it is not the cross between the
races, nor, we might add, is it any cross between
soul and ideas which makes these two women so
incomprehensible and almost enigmatical; one is
twice married, the other a girl, although she is
perhaps the more wearied and disillusioned of the
two,—and yet it is not the outer circumstances of
their lives which render both what they are, it is
something in themselves, quite apart from the experience
which beautifies and develops a woman’s
character; it is the keynote of their being which
retreats shyly to the background as though afraid
of the public gaze. It is the beginning of a series
of personal confessions at first hand, and forms an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
entirely new department in women’s literature.
Hitherto, as I have already said, all books, even
the best ones, written by women, are imitations of
men’s books, with the addition of a single high-pitched,
feminine note, and are therefore nothing
better than communications received at second
hand. But at last the time has come when woman
is so keenly alive to her own nature that she reveals
it when she speaks, even though it be in
riddles.</p>

<p>I have often pointed out that men only know
the side of our character which they wish to see,
or which it may please us to show them. If they
are thorough men, they seek the woman in us,
because they need it as the complement to their
own nature; but often they seek our “soul,” our
“mind,” our “character,” or whatever else they
may happen to look upon as the beautifying veil
of our existence. Something may come of the
first, but of the last nothing. Mrs. Egerton interpreted
man from the first of the above standpoints;
she wrote of him, half in hate and half in admiration;
her men are great clowns. The author of
“Dilettantes” wrote from the opposite point of
view; her man is the smooth-speaking <i>poseur</i>,
of whom she writes with a shrug of the shoulders
and an expression of mild contempt.</p>

<p>Both feel themselves to be so utterly different
from what they were told they were, and which
men believe them to be. They do not understand
it at all; they do not understand themselves in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
very least. They interpret nothing with the understanding,
but their instinct makes them feel quite
at home with themselves and leads them to assert
their own natures. They are no longer a reflection
which man moulds into an empty form; they
are not like Galatea, who became a living woman
through Pygmalion’s kiss; they were women before
they knew Pygmalion,—such thorough women
that Pygmalion is often no Pygmalion to them at
all, but a stupid lout instead.</p>

<p>It is a fearful disappointment, and causes a
woman—and many a womanly woman too—to
shrink from man and scan him critically. “You?”
she cries. “No, it were better not to love at all!”
But the day is coming—</p>

<p>And when the day has come, then woman will
be as bad as Strindberg’s Megoras, or as humorous
as a certain poetess who sent a portrait of her husband
to a friend, with this inscription: “My old
Adam;” or else she may meet with the same fate
as Countess Resa in the anonymous book of a
certain well-known authoress. She will commit
suicide in one way or the other. She will not
kill herself like Countess Resa, but she will kill
a part of her nature. And these women, who are
partly dead, carry about a corpse in their souls
from whence streams forth an odor as of death;
these women, whose dead natures have the power
of charming men with a mystery they would gladly
solve,—these women are our mothers, sisters,
friends, teachers, and we scarcely know the meaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
of the shiver down our backs which we feel
in their presence. A very keen consciousness is
needed to dive down deep enough in ourselves to
discover the reason, and very subtle, spiritual tools
are necessary to grasp the process and to reproduce
it. The Austrian authoress possessed both these
requisites. But there is also a third which is
equally indispensable to any one who would draw
such a portrait of themselves, and that is the distinguished
manner of a noble and self-confident
nature, in which everything can be said.</p>

<p>She has something besides, which gives the
book a special attraction of its own, and that is her
extremely modern, artistic feeling, which teaches
how the laws of painting can be brought to bear
upon the art of writing, and gives her a keen
appreciation of the value of sound in relation to
language.</p>

<p>There is a picture by Claude Monet,—pale,
golden sunshine upon a misty sea. There is
scarcely anything to be seen beyond this faint
golden haze, resting upon the shimmering, transparent
water, painted in rainbow colors, pale as
opal. There is just a faint suggestion of a promontory,
rising up from the warm, southern sea,
and something which looks like a squadron of fishing
boats in the far distance. It is not quite day,
but it is already light,—one of those cool mornings
which precede a dazzling day. It is years
since last I saw this picture, but it charmed me
so much that I have never forgotten it. It is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
consequence of this same sense for fine shades of
color, applied in this instance to the soul, that
“Dilettantes” was written.</p>

<p>It is a very quiet book, and just as there is not
a single strong color in Monet’s picture, so there
is not a single high note in this book. We feel
like gazing down into the water which glides and
glides along, carrying with it seaweed, dead bodies,
and men, but always in silence,—a most uneventful
book. But beneath this almost lethargical
stillness is enacted a tragedy in which a life is
at stake, and the stake is lost, and death is the
consequence. The deadliest blow against another’s
soul is caused, not by words, but by deafness and
indifference, by neglect at the moment when the
heart yearns for love, and the bud is ready to
blossom into flower beneath a single breath of
sympathy. Next morning, when you go to look
at it, you find it withered; it is then too late for
your warm breath and willing fingers to force it
open; you only make it worse, and at last the buds
fall to the ground.</p>

<p>The famous unknown has called her book
“Dilettantes,” although there is but one lady in
it to whom the name applies. Can it be that, by
her use of the plural, she meant to include herself
with the heroine? The supposition seems not
unlikely.</p>

<p>She introduces us to a colony of artists in Paris,
amongst whom is Baron Mark Sebenyi, an Hungarian
magnate, who is a literary dilettante. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
the house of the old Princess Ebendorf he makes
the acquaintance of her niece, Theresia Thaszary,
and feels himself drawn towards her as his “twin
soul.” During the Princess’s long illness, they
become engaged, and when the Princess dies he
continues his visits to the Countess as though her
aunt were still alive, and he spends his hours of
literary work in her house, because, as he says,
her presence is an indispensable source of inspiration
to him. Countess Resa is one of those whom
a life of constant travel has rendered cosmopolitan.
Her life is passed in a state of mental torpor
which is more general, and, I should like to
add, more normal, among young girls than men
imagine or married women remember; she was
neither contented nor discontented while she
lived with her aunt, and she continues the same
now, with Mark continually beside her. She is
glad to have him with her; she feels a certain
attraction in his manly and sympathetic presence,
and his behavior towards herself is so decorous
that it seldom happens that so much as a pressure
of the hand passes between them. She knows
that Mark has relations with other women, but
that fact does not enter into her womanly consciousness
at all.</p>

<p>All goes well until a fashionable friend of hers,
a rather vulgar lady, asks her when she means
to marry Mark, and persuades her to go into
society, although she has no desire to do so, and is
perfectly content with the sameness of her life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
In society she finds that her friendship with Mark
attracts observation, and this is the first shock
which leads to an awakening. In the long winter
hours, while she is sitting still in the room where
he is writing, she suddenly realizes the situation,
and feels that it is like a lover’s <i>tête-à-tête</i>. His
behavior in society irritates her in a hundred little
ways, because she knows that he is not true
to his real nature, and that he gives way to his
vanity as an author and poses in public. Mark
has no intention of marrying her; he is quite content
with matters as they stand. Cold-hearted,
and probably aged before his time, he feels drawn
towards her by a kind of distant, erotic feeling,
and he seeks her society for the sake of the drawing-room
where he can make himself thoroughly
at home and bring his artist friends; he likes her
because he is not bound to her, and he has never
tired of her because she was never his.</p>

<p>Spring comes. They make expeditions round
about Paris, and are constantly together; she is
in a state of nervous excitement, and the more
she feels drawn towards him the more she tries
to avoid him. There are moments when he too
feels his hand tremble, if by chance it comes into
contact with hers. Their friendship with one
another has become a hindrance to any greater
friendship between them; and he is too much
taken up with himself, too accustomed to have
her always busily attending to him, to notice the
change which is gradually taking place in her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Her love dwindles beneath the cold influence of
doubt, which increases the more as she feels herself
rejected by the man she loves. Ignorant
though she be, she is possessed of an intuitive
knowledge which is the heritage of many generations
of culture, which enables her to read
him through and through, until she conceives
an antipathy for him,—the man whose love she
desires,—an antipathy which makes him appear
contemptible and almost ridiculous in her sight.
Still she clings to him. She has no one else;
she is alone among strangers. He belongs to her
and she to him. This fact of their belonging to
each other makes her tire of his company, and
one day, when he and his literary friends are preparing
to hold lectures in her drawing-room, she
flies from the house to escape from their æsthetic
chatter.</p>

<p>At last she can stand it no longer, and whilst
her guests are engaged in discussing a work of
Mark’s, she goes downstairs and out into the
night. She scarcely knows what she is doing;
her pulse beats feverishly, her nerves are quite
unstrung. She walks down the street towards
the Champs Elysées, and there she meets a man
coming towards her. She perceives that she is
alone in the empty street, and she is overcome
with a nameless fear. Seized with a sudden impulse
to hide herself, she jumps into the nearest
cab, which is standing at the door of a café. The
driver asks, “Where to?” and when she does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
reply, he gets angry. At this juncture the man
appears at the door of the carriage, and she recognizes
Imre Borogh, a friend of Mark’s, who was
on his way to call on her. She still cannot say
where she wishes to go, but feeling herself under
the protection of a friend, she allows him to get
in. They drive and drive. She perceives the
compromising nature of the situation, but is too
stupefied to put an end to it. He talks to her
after the manner of an emotional young man,
whose feelings have gained the mastery over him.
At last he tells the driver to stop in front of a
café. She is half unconscious, but he assists her
to get out. And the nervous strain of these many
long months results in a misunderstanding with
this stranger, even greater than would have been
the case with Mark.</p>

<p>She comes very quietly home. She takes hold
of Mark’s portrait, as she has so often done before,
and compares it with her own image in the
looking-glass. She throws it away. She burns
his letters and all the little mementos which she
has of him, then—while she is searching in her
drawers—she comes upon a revolver....</p>

<p>Mark was very much moved at the funeral, and
he cherished her memory for long afterwards.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the book is there any attempt made
to describe men. The authoress only shows them
to us as they are reflected in her soul. In this
she not only shows an unusual amount of artistic
talent, but also a new method. Woman is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
most subjective of all creatures; she can only
write about her own feelings, and her expression
of them is her most valuable contribution to
literature. Formerly women’s writings were, for
the most part, either directly or indirectly, the
expression of a great falsehood. They were so
overpoweringly impersonal, it was quite comic to
see the way in which they imitated men’s models,
both in form and contents. Now that woman is
conscious of her individuality as a woman, she
needs an artistic mode of expression; she flings
aside the old forms, and seeks for new. It is
with this feeling, almost Bacchanalian in its
intensity, that Mrs. Egerton hurls forth her playful
stories, which the English critics judged
harshly, but the public bought and called for in
fresh editions; and this was how the Austrian
lady wrote her story, which has the effect of a
play dreamed under the influence of the sordine.
Both books are honest. The more conscious a
woman is of her individuality, the more honest
will her confession be. Honesty is only another
form of pride.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> characteristic is beginning to make
itself felt, which was bound to come at last. And
that is an intense and morbid consciousness of the
ego in women. This consciousness was unknown
to our mothers and grandmothers; they may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
had stronger characters than ours, as they undoubtedly
had to overcome greater hindrances;
but this consciousness of the ego is quite another
thing, and they had not got it.</p>

<p>Neither of these women, whose books I have
been reviewing, are authors by profession. There
is nothing they care for less than to write books,
and nothing that they desire less than to hear
their names on every one’s lips. Both were able
to write without having learned. Other authoresses
of whom we hear have either taught themselves
to write, or have been taught by men.
They began with an object, but without having
anything to say; they chose their subjects from
without.</p>

<p>Neither of these women have any object. They
do not want to describe what they have seen.
They do not want to teach the world, nor do they
try to improve it. They have nothing to fight
against. They merely put themselves into their
books. They did not even begin with the intention
of writing; they obeyed an impulse. There
was no question of whether they wished or not;
they were obliged. The moment came when they
were forced to write, and they did not concern
themselves with reasons or objects. Their ego
burst forth with such power that it ignored all
outer circumstances; it pressed forward and crystallized
itself into an artistic shape. These women
have not only a very pronounced style of their
own, but are in fact artists; they became it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
soon as they took up the pen. They had nothing
to learn, it was theirs already.</p>

<p>This is not only a new phase in the work
of literary production, it is also a new phase in
woman’s nature. Formerly, not only all great
authoresses, but likewise all prominent women,
were—or tried to be—intellectual. That also
was an attempt to accommodate themselves to
men’s wishes. They were always trying to follow
in the footsteps of the man. Man’s ideas,
interests, speculations, were to be understood and
sympathized with. When philosophy was the
fashion, great authoresses and intelligent women
philosophized. Because Goethe was wise, Rahel
was filled with the wisdom of life. George Eliot
preached in all her books, and philosophized all
her life long after the manner of Stuart Mill and
Herbert Spencer. George Sand was the receptacle
for ideas—men’s ideas—of the most contradictory
character, which she immediately reproduced
in her novels. Good Ebner-Eschenbach writes as
sensibly, and with as much tolerance, as a right
worthy old gentleman; and Fru Leffler chose
her subjects from among the problems which
were being discussed by a few well-known men.
None of their writings can be considered as essentially
characteristic of women. It was not an
altogether unjust assertion when men declared
that the women who wrote books were only half
women.</p>

<p>Yet these were the best. Others, who wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
as women, had no connection with literature at
all; they merely knitted literary stockings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Egerton and the author of “Dilettantes”
are not intellectual, not in the very least. The
possibility of being it has never entered their
brain. They had no ambition to imitate men.
They are not in the least impressed by the speculations,
ideas, theories, and philosophies of men.
They are sceptics in all that concerns the mind;
the man himself they can perceive.</p>

<p>They perceive his soul, his inner self,—when
he has one,—and they are keenly sensitive when
it is not there. The other women with the great
names are quite thick-headed in comparison.
They judge everything with the understanding;
these perceive with the nerves, and that is an
entirely different kind of understanding.</p>

<p>They understand man, but, at the same time,
they perceive that he is quite different from
themselves, that he is the contrast to themselves.
The one is too highly cultured; the other has too
sensitive a nervous system to permit the thought
of any equality between man and woman. The
idea makes them laugh. They are far too conscious
of being refined, sensitive women. They
do not concern themselves with the modern
democratic tendencies regarding women, with its
levelling of contrasts, its desire for equality.
They live their own life, and if they find it
unsatisfying, empty, disappointing, they cannot
change it. But they do not make any compromise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
to do things by halves; their highly-developed
nerves are too sure a standard to allow of
that. They are a new race of women, more
resigned, more hopeless, and more sensitive than
the former ones. They are women such as the
new men require; they have risen up on the
intellectual horizon as the forerunners of a generation
who will be more sensitive, and who
will have a keener power of enjoyment than the
former ones. Among themselves these women
exchange sympathetic glances, and are able to
understand one another without need of confession.
They, with their highly-developed nerves,
can feel for each other with a sympathy such as
formerly a woman only felt for man. In this
way they go through life, without building castles
in the air, or making any plans for the future;
they live on day by day, and never look beyond.
It might be said that they are waiting; but as
each new day arrives, and the sand of time falls
drop by drop upon their delicate nerves, even
this imperceptible burden is more than they can
bear; the strain of it is too much for them.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> before me a new book by Mrs. Egerton,
and two new photographs. In the one she is
sitting curled up in a chair, reading peacefully.
She has a delicate, rather sharp-featured profile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
with a long, somewhat prominent chin, that gives
one an idea of yearning. The other is a full-length
portrait. A slender, girlish figure, with
narrow shoulders, and a waist, if anything, rather
too small; a tired, worn face, without youth and
full of disillusion; the hair looks as though restless
fingers had been passed through it, and there
is a bitter, hopeless expression about the lines of
the mouth. In her letters—in which we never
wholly possess her, but merely her <i>mood</i>—she
comes to us in various guises,—now as a playful
kitten, that is curled up cosily, and sometimes
stretches out a soft little paw in playful, tender
need of a caress; or else she is a worried, disappointed
woman, with overwrought and excitable
nerves, sceptical in the possibility of content, a
seeker, for whom the charm lies in the seeking,
not in the finding. She is a type of the modern
woman, whose inmost being is the essence of
disillusion.</p>

<p>When we examine the portraits of the four principal
characters in this book—Sonia Kovalevsky,
Eleonora Duse, Marie Bashkirtseff, and George
Egerton—we find that they all have one feature
in common. It was not I who first noticed this,
it was a man. Ola Hansson, seeing them lying
together one day, pointed it out to me, and he
said: “The lips of all four speak the same language,—the
young girl, the great tragedian, the
woman of intellect, and the neurotic writer; each
one has a something about the corners of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
mouth that expresses a wearied satiety, mingled
with an unsatisfied longing, as though she had as
yet enjoyed nothing.”</p>

<p>Why this wearied satiety mingled with an
unsatisfied longing? Why should these four
women, who are four opposites, as it were, have
the same expression? The virgin in body and
soul, the great creator of the rôles of the degenerates,
the mathematical professor, and the neurotic
writer? Is it something in themselves,
something peculiar in the organic nature of their
womanhood, or is it some influence from without?
Is it because they have chosen a profession
which excites, while it leaves them dissatisfied,
for the simple reason that a profession can never
wholly satisfy a woman? Yet these four have
excelled in their profession. But can a woman
ever obtain satisfaction by means of her achievements?
Is not her life as a woman—as a wife
and as a mother—the true source of all her happiness?
And this touch of disillusion in all of
them—is it the disillusion they have experienced
as <i>woman</i>; is it the expression of their bitter
experiences in the gravest moment in a woman’s
life? Disappointment in man? <i>The</i> man that
fate thrust across their path, who was their experience?
And their yearning is now fruitless,
for the flower of expectant realization withered
before they plucked it.</p>

<p>Two of these women have carried the secret of
their faces with them to the grave, but the others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
live and are not willing to reveal it. George
Egerton would like to be as silent about it as
they are; but her nerves speak, and her nerves
have betrayed her secret in the book called
“Discords.”</p>

<p>When we read “Discords” we ask ourselves
how is it possible that this frail little woman
could write such a strong, brutal book? In
“Keynotes” Mrs. Egerton was still a little
coquette, with 5¾ gloves and 18-inch waist, who
herself played a fascinating part. She had something
of a midge’s nature, dancing up and down,
and turning nervous somersaults in the sunshine.
“Discords” is certainly a continuation of “Keynotes,”
but it is quite another kind of woman
who meets us here. The thrilling, nervous note
of the former book has changed into a clashing,
piercing sound, hard as metal; it is the voice of
an accuser in whom all bitterness takes the form
of reproaches which are unjust, and yet unanswerable.
It is the voice of a woman who is conscious
of being ill-treated and driven to despair,
and who speaks in spite of herself in the name of
thousands of ill-treated and despairing women.
Who can tell us whether her nerves have ill-treated
this woman and driven her to despair, or
whether it is her outward fate, especially her fate
with regard to the man? Women of this kind
are not confidential. They take back to-morrow
what they have confessed to-day, partly from a
wish not to let themselves be understood, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
partly because the aspect of their experiences
varies with every change of mood, like the colors
in a kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>But throughout these changes, one single note
is maintained in “Discords,” as it was in “Keynotes.”
In the latter it was a high, shrill treble,
like the song of a bird in spring; in “Discords”
it is a deep bass note, groaning in distress with
the groan of a disappointed woman.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> tone of bitter disappointment which pervades
“Discords” is the expression of woman’s
disappointment in man. Man and man’s love
are not a joy to her; they are a torment. He
is inconsiderate in his demands, brutal in his
caresses, and unsympathetic with those sides of
her nature which are not there for his satisfaction.
He is no longer the great comic animal
of “Keynotes,” whom the woman teases and
plays with—he is a nightmare which smothers
her during horrible nights, a hangman who tortures
her body and soul during days and years
for his pleasure; a despot who demands admiration,
caresses, and devotion, while her every nerve
quivers with an opposite emotion; a man born
blind, whose clumsy fingers press the spot where
the pain is, and when she moans, replies with
coarse, unfeeling laughter, “Absurd nonsense!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>Although I believed myself to be acquainted
with all the books which women have written
against men, no book that I have ever read has
impressed me with such a vivid sense of physical
pain. Most women come with reasonings, moral
sermons, and outbursts of temper: a man may
allow himself much that is forbidden to others,
that must be altered. Women are of no importance
in his eyes; he has permitted himself to
look down upon them. They intend to teach
him their importance. They are determined that
he shall look up to them. But here we have no
trace of Xantippe-like violence, only a woman
who holds her trembling hands to the wounds
which man has inflicted upon her, of which the
pain is intensified each time that he draws near.
A woman, driven to despair, who jumps upon
him like a wild-cat, and seizes him by the throat;
and if that does not answer, chooses for herself
a death that is ten times more painful than life
with him, <i>chooses</i> it in order that she may have
her own way.</p>

<p>What is this? It is not the well-known domestic
animal which we call woman. It is a wild
creature belonging to a wild race, untamed and
untamable, with the yellow gleam of a wild
animal in its eyes. It is a nervous, sensitive
creature, whose primitive wildness is awakened
by a blow which it has received, which bursts
forth, revengeful and pitiless as the lightning
in the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>That is what I like about this book. That a
woman should have sprung up, who with her
instinct can bore to the bottom layers of womanhood
the quality that enables her to renew the
race, her primæval quality, which man, with
all his understanding, has never penetrated. A
few years ago, in a study on Gottfried Keller’s
women, I mentioned wildness as the basis of
woman’s nature; Mrs. Egerton has given utterance
to the same opinion in “Keynotes,” and has
since tried to embody it in “Discords;” her best
stories are those where the wild instinct breaks
loose.</p>

<p>But why this terror of man, this physical repulsion,
as in the story called “Virgin Soil”? The
authoress says that it is because an ignorant girl
in her complete innocence is handed over in marriage
to an exacting husband. But that is not
reason enough. The authoress’s intellect is not
as true as her instinct. There must be something
more. The same may be said of “Wedlock,”
where the boarding-house cook marries an
amorous working man, who is in receipt of good
wages, for the sake of having her illegitimate
child to live with her; he refuses to allow it, and
when the child dies of a childish ailment, she
murders his two children by the first marriage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Egerton’s stories are not invented; neither
are they realistic studies copied from the notes
in her diary. They are experiences. She has
lived them all, because the people whom she portrays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
have impressed their characters or their
fate upon her quivering nerves. The music of
her nerves has sounded like the music of a
stringed instrument beneath the touch of a
strange hand, as in that masterpiece, “Gone
Under,” where the woman tells her story between
the throes of sea-sickness and drunkenness.
The man to whom she belongs has punished
her unfaithfulness by the murder of her
child, and she revenges herself by drunkenness;
yet, in spite of it all, he remains the master
whom she is powerless to punish, and in her
despair she throws herself upon the streets.</p>

<p>Only one man has had sufficient instinct to
bring to light this abyss in woman’s nature, and
that is Barbey d’Aurevilly, the poet who was
never understood. But in Mrs. Egerton’s book
there is one element which he had not discovered,
and, although she does not express it in words, it
shows itself in her description of men and women.
Her men are Englishmen with bull-dog natures,
but the women belong to another race; and is
not this horror, this physical repulsion, this
woman raging against the man, a true representation
of the way that the Anglo-Saxon nature
reacts upon the Celtic?</p>

<p>Two races stand opposed to one another in
these sketches; perhaps the authoress herself is
not quite conscious of it, but it is plainly visible
in her descriptions of character, where we have
the heavy, massive Englishman, <i>l’animal mâle</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
and the untamable woman who is prevented by
race instinct from loving where she ought to love.</p>

<p>In “The Regeneration of Two,” Mrs. Egerton
has tried to describe a Celtic woman where she
can love, but the attempt is most unsuccessful,
for here we see plainly that she lacked the basis
of experience. There are, however, many women
who know what love is, although they have never
experienced it. Men came, they married, but
the man for them never came.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a little story in this collection called
“Her Share,” where the style is full of tenderness,
perhaps even a trifle too sweet. It affects
one like a landscape on an evening in early
autumn, when the sun has gone down and twilight
reigns; it seems as though veiled in gray,
for there is no color left, although everything is
strangely clear. Mrs. Egerton has a peculiarly
gentle touch and soft voice where she describes
the lonely, independent working girl. Her little
story is often nothing more than the fleeting
shadow of a mood, but the style is sustained
throughout in a warm stream of lyric; for this
Celtic woman certainly has the lyrical faculty, a
thing which a woman writer rarely has, if ever,
possessed before. There is something in her
writing which seems to express a desire to draw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
near to the lonely girl and say: “You have such
a good time of it in your grayness. In Grayness
your nerves find rest, your instincts slumber, no
man ill-treats you with his love, you experience
discontent in contentment, but you know nothing
of the torture of unstrung nerves. Would
I were like you; but I am a bundle of electric
currents bursting forth in all directions into
chaos.”</p>

<p>Besides these two dainty twilight sketches, she
has others like the description in “Gone Under,”
of the storm on that voyage from America to
England where we imagine ourselves on board
ship, and seem to feel the rolling sea, to hear
the ship cracking and groaning, to smell the
hundreds of fetid smells escaping from all corners,
and the damp ship-biscuits and the taste of
the bitter salt spray on the tongue. We owe this
forcible and matter-of-fact method of reproducing
the impressions received by the senses to the
retentive power of her nerves, through which she
is able to preserve her passing impressions and
to reproduce them in their full intensity. She
relies on her womanly receptive faculty, not on
her brain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>George Egerton’s life has been of the kind
which affords ample material for literary purposes,
and it is probable that she has more raw
material ready for use at any time when she may
require it; but at present she retains it in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
nerves, as it were, under lock and key. She had
intended from childhood to become an artist, and
writing is only an afterthought; yet, no sooner
did she begin to write than the impressions and
experiences of her life shaped themselves into
the form of her two published works. Until the
publication of “Discords,” we had thought that
she was one of those intensely individualistic
writers who write one book because they must,
but never write another, or, at any rate, not one
that will bear comparison with the first; the publication
of “Discords” has entirely dispelled this
opinion, and has given us good reason to hope for
many more works from her pen.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A lean</span> figure, peculiarly attractive, though
scarcely to be called beautiful; a melancholy
face with a strangely sweet expression, no longer
young, yet possessed of a pale, wistful charm; <i>la
femme de trente ans</i>, who has lived and suffered,
and who knows that life is full of suffering;
a woman without any aggressive self-confidence,
yet queenly, gentle, and subdued in manner, with
a pathetic voice,—such is Eleonora Duse as she
appeared in the parts which she created for herself
out of modern pieces. When first I saw her,
I tried to think of some one with whom to compare
her; I turned over in my mind the names of
all the greatest actresses in the last ten years or
more, and wondered whether any of them could
be said to be her equal, or to have surpassed
her. But neither Wolter nor Bernhardt, neither
Ellmenreich nor the best actresses of the <i>Théâtre
Français</i>, could be compared with her. The French
and German actresses were entirely different;
they seemed to stand apart, each complete in
themselves—while she too stood apart, complete
in herself. They represented a world of their
own and a perfected civilization; and she, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
like them in some ways, seemed to represent
the genesis of a world, and a civilization in
embryo. This was not merely the result of comparing
an Italian with French and German, and
one school with another,—it was the woman’s
temperament compared to that of others, her
acute susceptibility, compared to which her celebrated
predecessors impressed one as being too
massive, almost too crude, and one might be
tempted to add, less womanly. Many of them
have possessed a more versatile genius than hers,
and nearly all have had greater advantages at
their disposal; but the moment that we compare
them to Duse, their loud, convulsive art suddenly
assumes the appearance of one of those
gigantic pictures by Makart, once so fiery colored
and now so faded; and if we compare the famous
dramatic artists of the seventies and eighties
with Duse, we might as well compare a splendid
festal march played with many instruments to a
Violin solo floating on the still night air.</p>

<p>The pieces acted by Eleonora Duse at Berlin,
where I saw her, were mainly chosen to suit the
public taste, and they differed in nothing from
the usual virtuosa programme. These consisted
of Sarah Bernhardt’s favorite parts, such as
“Fédora,” “La Dame aux Camélias,” and pieces
taken from the <i>répertoire</i> of the <i>Théâtre Français</i>,
such as “Francillon” and “Divorçons,” varied
with “Cavalleria Rusticana,” and such well-known
plays as “Locandiera,” “Fernande,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
“The Doll’s House.” She did not act Shakespeare,
and there she was wise; for what can
Duse’s pale face have in common with the exuberant
spirits and muscular strength of the
women of the <i>Renaissance</i>, whose own rich life-blood
shone red before their eyes and drove them
to deeds of love and vengeance, which it makes
the ladies of our time ill to hear described. But
she also neglected some pieces which must have
suited her better than her French <i>répertoire</i>. She
did not give us Marco Praga’s “Modest Girls,”
where Paulina’s part seems expressly created for
her, nor his “Ideal Wife,” into which she might
have introduced some of her own instinctive philosophy.
Neither did she act the “Tristi Amori”
of her celebrated fellow-countryman, Giuseppe
Giacosa.</p>

<p>And yet, in the parts which she did act, she
opened to us a new world, which had no existence
before, because it was her own. It was the world
of her own soul, the ever-changing woman’s world,
which no one before her has ever expressed on
the stage; she gave us the secret, inner life of
woman, which no poet can wholly fathom, and
which only woman herself can reveal, which with
more refined nerves and more sensitive and varied
feelings has emerged bleeding from the older,
coarser, narrower forms of art, to newer, brighter
forms, which, though more powerful, are also
more wistful and more hopeless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Eleonora Duse</span> has a strangely wearied look.
It is not the weariness of exhaustion or apathy,
nor is it the weariness natural to an overworked
actress, although there are times when she suffers
from that to so great an extent that she acts
indifferently the whole evening, and makes the
part a failure. Neither is it the weariness of
despondency which gives the voice a hollow,
artificial sound, which is noticeable in all virtuosas
when they are over-tired. Neither is it
the utter prostration resulting from passion, like
the drowsiness of beasts of prey, which our tragic
actors and actresses delight in. Passion, the so-called
great passion, which, according to an old
legend recounted in one of the Greek tragedies,
comes like the whirlwind, and leaves nothing
behind but death and dried bones—passion such
as that is unknown to Duse. Brunhild, Medea,
Messalina, and all the ambitious, imperious princesses
of historic drama are nothing to her; she
is no princess or martyr of ancient history, but a
princess in her own right, and a martyr of circumstances.
Throughout her acting there is a
feeling of surprise that she should suffer and be
martyred, accompanied by the dim knowledge
that it must be so—and it is that which gives
her soul its weary melancholy. For it is not her
body, nor her senses, nor her mind which give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
the appearance of having just awoke from a deep
lethargy; the weariness is all in her soul, and it
is that which gives her a soft, caressing, trustful
manner, as though she felt lonely, and yearned for
a little sympathy. Love is full of sympathy, and
that is why Eleonora Duse acts love. Not greedy
love, which asks more than it gives, like Walter’s
and Bernhardt’s; not sensual love, nor yet imperious
love, like the big woman who takes pity
on the little man, whom it pleases her to make
happy. When Duse is in love, even in “Fédora,”
it is always she who is the little woman, and the
man is for her the big man, the giver, who holds
her happiness in his hands, to whose side she
steals anxiously, almost timidly, and looks up at
him with her serious, wearied, almost child-like
smile. She comes to him for protection and
shelter, just as travelers are wont to gather
round a warm fire, and she clings to him caressingly
with her thin little hands,—the hands of a
child and mother. Never has woman been represented
in a more womanly way than by Eleonora
Duse; and more than that, I take it upon myself
to maintain that woman has never been represented
upon the stage until now—by Eleonora
Duse.</p>

<p>She shows us the everlasting child in woman,—in
the full-grown, experienced woman, who is
possessed of an erotic yearning for fulness of life.
Woman is not, and cannot be, happy by herself,
nor is the sacrifice of a moment enough for her;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
it is not enough for her to live by the side of the
man; a husband’s tenderness is as necessary to
her as the air she breathes. His passion, lit by
her, is her life and happiness. He gives her the
love in which her life can blossom into a fair and
beautiful flower. And she accepts him, not with
the silly innocence of a child, not with the
ignorance of girlhood, not with the ungoverned
passion of a mistress, not with the condescending
forbearance of the “superior woman,” not with
the brotherly affection of the manly woman,—we
have had ample opportunity of seeing and benefiting
by such representations as those in every
theatre, and in every tongue, since first we began
to see and to think. They include every type
of womanhood as understood and represented by
actresses great and small. But into all this, Duse
introduces a new element, something which was
formerly only a matter of secondary importance on
the stage, which, by the “highest art,” was judged
in the light of a juggler’s trick, and was
considered by the lower art as little more than a
valuable ingredient. She makes it the main-string
on which her acting vibrates, the keynote
without which her art would have no meaning.
She accepts the man with the whole-hearted sincerity
of an experienced woman, who shrinks from
the loneliness of life, and longs to lose herself in
the “loved one”. She has the dreadful sensation
that a human being has nothing but minutes,
minutes; that there is nothing lasting to rely on;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
that we swim across dark waters from yesterday
until to-morrow, and our unfulfilled desires are
less terrible than the feverish anxiety with which
we anticipate the future in times of prosperity.</p>

<p>Eleonora Duse’s acting tells of infinite suspense.</p>

<p>Her entire art rests on this one note,—Suspense:
which means that we know nothing, possess
nothing, can do nothing; that everything is ruled
by chance, and the whole of life is one great uncertainty.
This terrible insecurity stands as a
perfect contrast to the “cause and effect” theory
of the schools, which trust in God and logic, and
offer a secure refuge to the playwright’s art.
This mysterious darkness, from whence she steps
forward like a sleep-walker, gives a sickly coloring
to her actions. There is something timid
about her; she seems to have an almost superstitious
dislike of a shrill sound, or a brilliant color;
and this peculiarity of hers finds expression not
only in her acting, but also in her dress.</p>

<p>We seldom see toilets on the stage which reveal
a more individual taste. Just as Duse never acted
anything but what was in her own soul, she never
attempted any disguise of her body. Her own
face was the only mask she wore when I saw her
act. The expression of her features, the deep
lines on her cheeks, the melancholy mouth, the
sunken eyes with their large heavy lids, were all
characteristic of the part. She always had the
same black, broad, arched eyebrows, the same
wavy, shiny black Italian hair, which was always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
done up in a modest knot, sometimes high, sometimes
a little lower, from which two curls always
escaped during the course of her acting, because
she had a habit of brushing her forehead with a
white and rather bony hand, as though every
violent emotion made her head ache.</p>

<p>No jewel glittered against her sallow skin, and
she wore no ornament on her dress; there was
something pathetic in the unconcealed thinness
of her neck and throat. She was of medium
height, a slender body with broad hips, without
any signs of the rounded waist which belongs to
the fashionable figure of the drama. She wore no
stays, and there was nothing to hinder the slow,
graceful, musical movements of her somewhat
scanty figure. She made frequent gestures with
her arms which were perfectly natural in her,
although her Italian vivacity sometimes gave
them a grotesque appearance. But it was the
grace of her form, rather than her gestures, which
called attention to the natural stateliness of her
person. As to her dresses, they were not in the
least fashionable, there was nothing of the French
fashion-plate style about them; but then she never
made any attempt to follow the fashion,—she set
it. There was an antique look about the long
soft folds of her dress, also something suggestive
of the <i>Renaissance</i> in the velvet bodices and low
lace collars.</p>

<p>But her arrangement of color was new; it was
not copied either from the antique or the <i>Renaissance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span></i>,
and it was certainly not in accordance with
the present-day fashion. She never wore red,—with
the exception of Nora’s shabby blouse,—nor
bright yellow, nor blue; never, in fact, any strong,
deep color. The hues which she affected most
were black and white in all materials, whether
for dresses or cloaks. She always wore pale,
cream-colored lace, closely folded across her
breast, from whence her dress fell loosely to the
ground; she never wore a waist-band of any kind
whatever.</p>

<p>She sometimes wore pale bronze, faded violet,
and quiet myrtle green in soft materials of velvet
and silk. There was an air of mourning about
her dresses which might have suited any age
except merry youth, and that note was entirely
absent from her art, for she was never merry.
She had a happy look sometimes, but she was
never merry or noisy on the stage. I have twice
seen her in a hat; and they were sober hats, such
as a widow might wear.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I saw</span> Duse for the first time as “Nora.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I was
sorry for it, as I did not think that an Italian
could act the part of a heroine with such an
essentially northern temperament. I have never
had an opportunity of seeing Frau Ramlo, who is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
considered the best Nora on the German stage,
but I have seen Ibsen’s Nora, Fru Hennings of
the Royal Theatre of Copenhagen, and I retained
a vivid picture of her acting in my mind. Fru
Hennings’ Nora was a nervous little creature,
with fair hair and sharp features, very neat and
<i>piquante</i>, but dressed cheaply and not always with
the best taste; she was the regular tradesman’s
daughter, with meagre purse and many pretensions,
whose knowledge of life was bounded by
the narrow prejudices of the parlor. There was
something undeveloped about this Nora, with her
senseless chatter, something almost pitiable in
her admiration for the self-important Helmer,
and something childish in her conception of his
hidden heroism. There was also a natural, and
perhaps inherited tendency for dishonest dealings,
and a well-bred, forced cheerfulness which
took the form of hopping and jumping in a
coquettish manner, because she knew that it
became her. When the time comes that she is
obliged to face life with its realities, her feeble
brain becomes quite confused, and she hops round
the room in her tight stays, with her fringe and
high-heeled boots, till, nervous and void of self-control
as she is, she excites herself into the
wildest apprehensions. This apprehension was
the masterpiece of Fru Hennings’ masterly acting.
She kept the mind fixed on a single point,
which had all the more powerful effect in that it
was so characteristically depicted,—she showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
us the way by which a respectable tradesman’s
daughter may be driven to the madhouse or to
suicide. But when the change takes place, and
a fully developed, argumentative, woman’s rights
woman jumps down upon the little goose, then
even Fru Hennings’ undoubted art was not equal
to the occasion. The part fell to pieces, and two
Noras remained, connected only by a little thread,—the
miraculous. Fru Hennings disappears with
an unspoken <i>au revoir!</i></p>

<p>When Eleonora Duse comes upon the stage as
Nora, she is a pale, unhealthy-looking woman,
with a very quiet manner. She examines her
purse thoughtfully, and before paying the servant
she pauses involuntarily, as poor people usually
do before they spend money. And when she
throws off her shabby fur cloak and fur cap, she
appears as a thin, black-haired Italian woman,
clad in an old, ill-fitting red blouse. She plays
with the children, without any real gayety, as
grown-up people are in the habit of playing
when their thoughts are otherwise occupied.
Fru Linden enters, and to her she tells her
whole history with true Italian volubility, but in
an absent manner, like a person who is not thinking
of what she is saying. She likes best to sit
on the floor—very unlike women of her class—and
to busy herself with the Christmas things.
In the scene with Helmer an expression of submissive
tenderness comes over her, she likes to
be with him, she feels as though his presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
afforded her protection, and she nestles to his
side, more like a sick person than a child.</p>

<p>The scenes which are impressed with Nora’s
modern nervousness come and go, but Duse
never becomes nervous. The many emotional
and sudden changes which take place, the unreasonable
actions and other minor peculiarities
of a child of the <i>bourgeois décadence</i>,—these do
not concern her. Duse never acts the nervous
woman, either here or elsewhere. She does not
act it, because she has too true and delicate a
nervous susceptibility. She can act the most
passionate feelings, and she often does so; but
she never acts a capricious, nervous disposition.
She has too refined a taste for that, and her soul
is too full of harmony.</p>

<p>Ibsen’s Nora is hysterical, and only half a
woman; and that is what he, with his poetic
intuition, intended her to be. Eleonora Duse’s
Nora is a complete woman. Crushed by want
and living in narrow surroundings, there is a
certain obtuseness about her which renders her
willing to subject herself to new misfortunes.
There is also something of the child in her, as
there is in every true woman; but even in her
child-like moments she is a sad child. Then the
misfortune happens! But, strange to say, she
makes no desperate attempt to resist it; she gives
no hysterical cry of fear, as a meaner soul would
do in the struggle for life. There is something
pitiable in a struggle such as that, where power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
and will are so disproportionately unlike. Duse’s
Nora hastily suppresses the first suggestion of
fear; but she does not admire her muff meanwhile,
like Fru Hennings. She merely repeats
to herself over and over again in answer to her
thoughts: “No, no!” I never heard any one say
“no” like her; it contains a whole world of
human feeling. But all through the night she
hears fate say “Yes, yes!” and the next day,
which is Christmas Day, she is overcome with a
fatalistic feeling. She dresses herself for the
festival, but not with cheap rags like Nora; she
wears an expensive dark green dress, which hangs
down in rich graceful folds. It is her only best
dress, and sets off her figure to perfection; it
makes her look tall and slender, but also very
weary. And as the play goes on, she becomes
even more weary and more resigned, and when
death comes, there is no help for it. Then, after
the rehearsal of the tarantella, when Helmer calls
to her from the dining-room and she knows that
fate can no longer be averted, she leaps through
the air into his arms with a cry of joy,—to look
at her one would think that she was one of those
thin, wild, joyless Bacchantes whose bas-reliefs
have come down to us from the later period of
Grecian art.</p>

<p>The third act:—Nora and Helmer return from
the mask ball. She is absent-minded and quite
indifferent to everything that goes on around her.
That which she knows is going to happen, is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
her already a thing of the past, since she has
endured it all in anticipation; her actions in the
matter are only mechanical.</p>

<p>When Helmer goes to empty the letter-box, she
does not try to stop him with a hundred excuses,
she scarcely makes a weak movement to hold him
back; she knows that it must come, nothing that
she can do will prevent it. While Helmer reads
the letter, she stands pale and motionless, and
when he rushes at her, she throws on her mantle
and leaves the room without another word.</p>

<p>He drags her back and overwhelms her with
reproaches, in which the pitiful meanness of his
soul is laid bare. Now Duse’s acting begins in
earnest, now the dramatic moment has come—the
only moment in the drama—for the sake of
which she took the part.</p>

<p>She stands by the fireplace, with her face
towards the audience, and does not move a muscle
until he has finished speaking. She says nothing,
she never interrupts him. Only her eyes
speak. He runs backwards and forwards, up and
down the room, while she follows him with her
large, suffering eyes, which have an unnatural
look in them, follows him backwards and forwards
in unutterable surprise,—a surprise which
seems to have fallen from heaven, and which
changes little by little into an unutterable, inconceivable
disappointment, and that again into an
indescribably bitter, sickening contempt. And
into her eyes comes at last the question: “Who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
are you? What have you got to do with me?
What do you want here? What are you talking
about?”</p>

<p>The other letter drops into the letter-box, and
Helmer loads her with tender, patronizing words.
But she does not hear him. She is no longer looking
at him. What does the chattering creature
want now? She does not know him at all. She
has never loved him. There was once a man
whose sympathy she possessed, and who was her
protector. That man is no more, and she has
never loved any one!</p>

<p>She turns away with a gesture of displeasure,
and goes to change her clothes, anxious to get
away as quickly as possible. He stops her.
What then? The woman is awake in her. She
is a woman in the moment of a woman’s greatest
ignominy,—when she discovers that she does not
love. What does he want with her? Why does
he raise objections? He——? <i>Tant de bruit
pour une omelette!</i> She throws him a few indifferent
words, shrugs her shoulders, turns her
back upon him, and goes quickly out at the door.
Presently we hear the front door close with a
bang. There is no mention at all about the
“miracle.”</p>

<p>That is how Duse united Nora’s double personality.
Make it up! There is no making it up
between the man and wife, except the kiss and the
shrug of the shoulders. She ignores Ibsen’s principal
argument. Reason, indeed? Reason has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
never settled anything in stern reality, least of
all as regards the relationship between husband
and wife. One day Nora wakes up and finds that
Helmer has become loathsome to her, and she
runs away from him with the instinctive horror
of a living person for a decomposed corpse. Of
course nothing “miraculous” can happen, for that
would mean that the living person should go mad
and return to the corpse.</p>

<p>Eleonora Duse treats all her parts in the same
independent manner that she treats the text of
Nora. When we are able to follow her, and that
is by no means always, we notice how she alters
it to suit herself, how another being comes to the
front,—a being who has no place in the written
words, and whom the author never thought of,
whom he, in most cases, could certainly not have
drawn from his own views of life and his own
inner consciousness. Duse’s heroine is more
womanly, in the deeper sense of the word, than
the society ladies in Ibsen’s and Sardou’s dramas,
and she is not only more simple than they are,
but also far greater. Eleonora Duse is not a
dialectician like Ibsen and Sardou; their hair-splitting
logic is no concern of hers, and it certainly
was not written for her. She has an
instinctive, unerring intuition of what the part
should be, and she throws herself into it and acts
accordingly. She does not vary much; she is not
a realist who makes a careful note of every little
peculiarity, and arranges them in a pattern of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
mosaic; she is truthful to a reckless extent, but
not always true to the letter; sometimes like
this, sometimes like that, she differs in the
different parts. She is true, because she is proud
and courageous enough to show herself as she
really is. There is no need for her to be otherwise.
There is danger of uniformity in this great
simplicity of hers, and she would not escape it
if it were not for her emotional nature, and an
intense, almost painful sincerity, which was perhaps
never represented on the stage before her
time, and which was certainly never before made
the groundwork of a woman’s feelings. She
comes to meet us half absorbed in her own
thoughts, a complete woman,—complete in that
indissoluble unity which is the basis of a healthy
woman’s nature: woman-child and also woman-mother,
a woman with the stamp which is the
result of deep, vital experience, with a woman’s
tragedy ineffaceably engraved on every feature,—this
same woman’s tragedy which she reproduces
upon the stage. It is the fact of her not troubling
herself about anything else that imbues her
acting with an air of simplicity, and because she
is such a complete woman herself, there is an air
of indescribable stateliness about her acting. She
not only simplified all that she took in hand, but
she also improved it. For all these characters
which she created were the result of the completeness
of her womanly nature, and that is why
they never had but the one motive, for all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
evil they did, and for their hate: they revenged
themselves for the <i>crimen læsæ majestatis</i>, which
sin was committed against their womanly nature,
and which a true woman never forgives, as when
the priceless pearl of her womanhood has been
misused. That is why they made no pathetic
gestures, no noise or tragic screams, but acted
quietly and silently, as we do a thing which is
expected of us, with a quiet indifference, as when
intact nature bows itself under and assists fate.</p>

<p>That is how Duse acted Nora, but she acted
Clotilde in “Fernande” in the same mood, also
Odette in the play, called by the same name, both
by Sardou, and that was more difficult. Clotilde
and Odette are a couple of vulgar people. Clotilde,
a widow of distinction, revenges herself upon a
young man of proud and noble family, who has
been her lover for many years, but has broken
his marriage vows, by encouraging his attachment
for a dishonored girl, whom she persuades him to
marry, and afterwards triumphantly tells him his
wife’s history.</p>

<p>Odette’s husband finds her one night with her
lover, and he turns her out of the house in the
presence of witnesses. For several years she leads
a dissolute life, dishonoring the name of her husband
and grown-up daughter. This stain on the
family makes it almost impossible for the latter
to marry, and the husband offers the fallen woman
a large sum of money to deprive her of his name.
She agrees, on condition that she shall be allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
to see her daughter. She is prevented from making
herself known to the latter, and when she
comes away after the interview, she drowns herself
in a fit of hysterical self-contempt. Such
are the contents of the two pieces into which
Duse put her greatest and best talent.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> comes as Clotilde into the gambling saloon,
to inquire after the young girl whom she had
nearly driven over. She is simply dressed, and
has the appearance of a distinguished lady, with
a happy and virtuous past. The manner in which
she receives the girl in her own house, talks to
her and puts her at her ease, was so kind and
hearty that the audience, very unexpectedly in
this scene, broke into a storm of applause before
the curtain had gone down. Her lover returns
from a journey which arouses her suspicion, and
she, anxious not to deceive herself, elicits the
confession that he no longer cares for her, and
is in love with some one else. That some one
is Fernande. He goes to look for her, finds her
in the same house, and returns immediately.
Clotilde thinks that he has come back to her.
Her speechless delight must be seen, for it cannot
be described; her whole being is suffused
with a radiant joy, she trembles with excitement.
When it is all made plain to her, and there is no
longer any room for doubt, she bows her head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
over his hand for an instant, as though to kiss
it, as she had so often done before, then she
strokes it softly with her own.... She will
never look into his face again, yet she cannot
cease to love the clear, caressing hand, which
calls to mind her former happiness.</p>

<p>She lets things take their course, and when it
is over she has the scene with Pomerol, when she
defends her conduct. Duse has a form of dialectic
peculiar to herself, which is neither sensible
nor deliberate, but impulsive. When she
does wrong she does it—not because she is bad,
but because she cannot help herself. A part of
her nature, which was the source of her life, is
wounded and sick unto death, and a gnawing,
burning pain compels her to commit deeds as
dark and painful as her own heart. She goes
about it quietly, doing it all as a matter of
course; to her they seem inevitable as the outer
expression of a hidden suffering.</p>

<p>She is at her best in the passionate “Fédora,”
when she represents this state of blank amazement,
mingled with despair, taking the place of
what has been love. If she afterwards comes
across the French cynic, she reasons with him
too—but like a woman, <i>i.e.</i>, she drowns his arguments
in an extraordinary number of interjections,
with or without words. She never crosses
the threshold of her life as an actress, she never
once attains to the consciousness of objective
judgment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>When the man whom she loves is married to
the dishonored girl, Clotilde comes to bring him
the information which she has reserved until
now. Suddenly she stands in the doorway, and
sees that he is alone, and there comes over her
an indescribable expression of dumb, suppressed
love. She seems to be making a frantic appeal
to the past to be as though it had never taken
place, and in the emotion of the moment she has
forgotten what brought her there. Not until he
has unceremoniously shown her the door, and
opened the old wound, does she tell him who his
wife is.</p>

<p>The same with “Odette.” She is in love, and
she receives her lover. At that moment her
husband comes home. (Andó, Duse’s partner, is
almost as good an actor as she is.) He is a shallow,
restless, hot-tempered little man, who seizes
her by the shoulders as she is about to throw herself
into the other man’s arms. She collapses
altogether, and stands before him stammering
and ashamed. He thrusts her out of the house,
although it is the middle of the night, and she is
lightly clad. In a moment she has drawn herself
up to her full height,—a woman deprived of home
and child, on whom the deadliest injury has been
inflicted in the most barbarous manner; in the
presence of such cruelty, her own fault sinks to
nothing, and with a voice as hoarse as that of an
animal at bay, she cries, “Coward!” and leaves
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>Many years have gone by, and we meet Odette
once more, this time as a courtesan in a gambling
saloon. She is very much aged,—a thin, disillusioned
woman, for whom her husband is searching
everywhere, with the intention of depriving
her of his name. There is still something about
her which bears the impress of the injured woman.
She recalls the past as clearly as though it happened
only yesterday; for she can never forget it,
and time has not lessened the disgrace. She treats
him with wearied indifference, and her voice is
harsh like an animal’s, and she chokes as though
she were trying to smother her indignation.</p>

<p>Then follows the last act, when she meets her
daughter. She comes in, dressed like an unhappy
old widow, shaking with emotion, and scarcely
able to contain herself. Her eyes are aglow with
excitement, as she rushes forward, ready to cast
herself into her daughter’s arms. But when she
sees the fresh, innocent girl, she is overcome with
a feeling of shyness, and shrinks from her with
an awkward, anxious gesture. She speaks hesitatingly,
like one who is ill at ease; she raises
her shoulders and stoops, and holds her thin,
restless hands clasped together, lest they should
touch her daughter. The girl displays the various
little souvenirs that belonged to her mother,
and plays the piece which was her favorite, and
talks about her “dead mother.” Then this man
and woman are stirred with a deep feeling, which
is the simple keynote of humanity, which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
never experienced before in the days when they
were together. And they sit and cry, each buried
in their own sorrow, and far apart from one
another. After that she puts her trembling arms
round the girl, and kisses her with an expression
in her face which it is impossible to simulate,
and which cannot be imitated,—which no one
understands except the woman who is herself a
mother. She gazes at her daughter as though
she could never see enough of her; she strokes
her with feverish hands, arranges the lace on her
dress, and you feel the joy that it is to her to
touch the girl, and to know that she is really
there. Then she becomes very quiet, as though
she had suffered all that it was possible for her to
suffer. As she passes her husband, she catches
hold of his outstretched hand, and tries to kiss
it. Then she tears herself away, overcome with
the feeling that she can endure it no longer.</p>

<p>Eleonora Duse prefers difficult parts. She
was nothing more than an ordinary actress in
“La Locandiera,” and the witty dialogue in
“Cyprienne” and “Francillon” had little in common
with her nature. Even the part of “La
Dame aux Camélias” was an effort to her. The
silly, frivolous cocotte, with her consumptive
longing to be loved, was too exaggerated a part
for Eleonora Duse. A superabundance of good
spirits is foreign to her nature, which is sad as
life itself. Pride and arrogance she cannot act,
nor yet the trustfulness which comes from inexperience.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
She gave the impression of not feeling
young enough for “La Dame aux Camélias’”
happy and unhappy moods. Eleonora Duse’s art
is most at home where life’s great enigma begins:—Where
do we come from? Why are we here?
Where are we going to? We are tossed to and
fro on the waters in a dense fog; we suffer wrong,
and we do wrong, and we know not why. Fate!
fate! We are powerless in the hands of Fate!
When Duse can act the blindness of fatalism,
then she is content.</p>

<p>She was able to do so in “Fédora.”</p>

<p>The pretty, fashionable heroine does not change
into a fury when the man whom she loves is
brought home murdered. When we meet her
again she is quite quiet,—a calm, cold woman of
the world, with only one object in life, which is
to punish the murderer. It is a task like any
other, but it is inevitable, and must be undertaken
as a matter of course. She makes no display
of anger, and takes no perverse pleasure in
thoughts of vengeance. The murderer is nothing
to her,—he is a stranger. But she has been rendered
desolate in the flower of her youth; the
table of life, which is never spread more than
once, has been upset before her eyes at the very
moment of her anticipated happiness, and this is
an injury which she is going to repay. She is
proud, and has no illusions; she is a just judge,
who recompenses evil with evil and good with
good. This “Fédora” is reserved and unreasoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>The scene changes. She loves the man whom
she has been pursuing, and she discovers that the
dead man has been false to both of them, and she
realizes that now for the first time life’s table is
spread for her, while the secret police, to whom
she has betrayed him, are waiting outside, and
she clings to him terrified, showers caresses upon
him, kisses him with unspeakable tenderness.
There is something in her of the helplessness of
a little child, mingled with a mother’s protecting
care, as she implores him to remain, and entices
him to love, and seeks refuge in his love, as a
terrified animal seeks refuge in its hole.</p>

<p>There are two other features of Eleonora Duse’s
art which deserve notice. These are, the way in
which she tells a lie, and the way she acts death.
As I have said already, she is not a realist, and
she frames her characters from her inner consciousness,
not from details gathered from the
outward features of life. Her representation of
death is also the outcome of her instinct. A
death scene has no meaning for her unless it
reflects the inner life. As a process of physical
dissolution, she takes no interest in it. She has
not studied death from the side of the sick-bed,
and she makes short work of it in “Fédora,” as
also in “La Dame aux Camélias.” In the first
piece, the point which she emphasizes is the
sudden determination to take the poison; in the
second, it is her joy at having the man whom she
loves near her at the last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Then her manner of lying. When Duse tells
a lie, she does it as if it were the simplest and
most natural thing in the world. Her lies and
deceptions are as engaging, persuasive, and fantastic
as a child’s. Lying is an important factor
in the character of a woman who has much to fight
against, and it is a weapon which she delights to
use, and the use of it renders her unusually fascinating
and affectionate. Even those who do
not understand the words of the play, know when
Duse is telling a lie, because she becomes so
unusually lively and talkative, and her large eyes
have an irresistible sparkle in them.</p>

<p>“Cavalleria Rusticana” was the only good Italian
play that Duse acted. She was more of a realist
in this piece than in any other, because she reproduced
what she had seen daily before her eyes,—her
native surroundings, her fellow-countrymen,—instead
of that which she had learned by listening
to her own soul. Her Santuzza—the poor, forsaken
girl with the raw, melancholy, guttural
accents of despair—was life-like and convincing,
but the barbaric wildness of the exponent was
something which was as startling in this stupid,
pale weakly creature as a roar from the throat of
a roe deer.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now to sum up:—Eleonora Duse goes touring
all round the world. She is going to America,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and she is certain to go back to Berlin and St.
Petersburg and Vienna, and other places where
she may or may not have been before. She will
have to travel and act, travel and act, as all popular
actresses have done before her. She will grow
tired of it, unspeakably tired,—we can see that
already,—but she will be obliged to go on, till
she becomes stereotyped, like all the others.</p>

<p>When we see her again, will she be the same as
she is now? Her technical power is extraordinary,
but her art is simple; melancholy and dignity
are its chief ingredients. Will Duse’s womanly
nature be able to bear the strain of never-ending
repetition? This fear has been the cause of my
endeavor to accentuate her individuality as it
appeared to me when I saw her. Hers is not
one of those powerful natures which always regain
their strength, and are able to fight through all
difficulties. Her entire acting is tuned upon one
note, which is usually nothing more than an
accompaniment in the art of acting; that note
is sincerity. In my opinion she is the greatest
woman genius on the stage.</p>

<p>Nowadays we are either too lavish or too sparing
in our use of the word genius; we either brandish
it abroad with every trumpet, or else avoid it altogether.
We are willing to allow that there are
geniuses amongst actors and actresses, and that
such have existed, and may perhaps continue to
exist, but I have never observed that any attempt
is made to distinguish between the genius of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
man and woman on the stage. This may possibly
be accounted for by the fact that the difference
was not great. The hero was manly, the heroine
womanly, and the old people, whether men or
women, were either comic or tearful, and the
characters of both sexes were usually bad. The
difference lay chiefly in the dress, the general
comportment, and the voice: one could see which
was the woman, and she of course acted a woman’s
feelings; tradition ruled, and in accordance with
it the actress imitated the man, declaimed her
part like him, and even went as far as to imitate
the well-known tragic step. Types, not individuals,
were represented on the stage, and I
have seldom seen even the greatest actresses of
the older school deviate from this rule.</p>

<p>The society pieces were supposed to represent
every-day life; therefore it was necessary before all
else that the actress should be a lady, and where a
lady’s feelings are limited, hers were necessarily
limited too. To every actress, the tragedian not
excepted, the question of chief importance was
how she looked.</p>

<p>But Duse does not care in the least how she
looks. Her one desire is to find means of expressing
an emotion of the soul which overwhelms her,
and is one of the mysteries of her womanly nature.
Her acting is not realistic; by which I mean that
she does not attempt to impress her audience by
making her acting true to life, which can be easily
attained by means of pathological phenomena, such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
as a cough, the cramp, a death-struggle, etc.,
which are really the most expressive, and also, in
a coarse way, the most successful. She will have
none of this, because it is the kind of acting common
to both sexes. What she wants is to give
expression to her own soul, her own womanly
nature, the individual emotions of her own physical
and psychical being; and she can only accomplish
that by being entirely herself, <i>i.e.</i>, perfectly
natural. That is why she makes gesticulations,
and speaks in a tone of voice which is never used
elsewhere upon the stage; and she never tries to
disguise her age, because her body is nothing
more to her than an instrument for expressing
her woman’s soul.</p>

<p>What is genius? The word has hitherto been
understood to imply a superabundance of intelligence,
imagination, and passion, combined with
a higher order of intellect than that possessed by
average persons. Genius was a masculine attribute,
and when people spoke of woman’s genius,
their meaning was almost identical. A finer
spiritual susceptibility scarcely came under the
heading of genius; it was therefore, upon the
whole, a very unsatisfactory definition. There
can be no doubt that there is a kind of genius
peculiar to women, and it is when a woman is a
genius that she is most unlike man, and most
womanly; it is then that she creates through the
instrumentality of her womanly nature and refined
senses. This is the kind of productive faculty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
which Eleonora Duse possesses to such a high
degree.</p>

<p>A woman’s productive faculty has always shown
a decided preference for authorship and acting,—the
two forms of art which offer the best opportunity
for the manifestation of the inner life, as
being the most direct and spontaneous, and in
which there are the fewest technical difficulties
to overcome. A woman’s impulses are of such
short duration that she feels the need for constant
change of emotion. The majority of women are
attracted by the stage, and there is no form of
artistic production which they find more difficult
to renounce. Why is this? We will leave vanity
and other minor considerations out of the question,
and imagine Duse shedding real tears upon
the stage, enduring real mental and maybe physical
sufferings, experiencing real sorrow and real
joy.</p>

<p>And now, putting aside all question of nerves
and auto-suggestion, we would ask what it is that
attracts a woman to the stage?</p>

<p>Sensation.</p>

<p>A productive nature cannot endure the monotony
of real life. To it, real life means uniformity.
Uniformity in love, uniformity in work, uniformity
in pleasures, uniformity in sorrows. To
break through this uniformity—this half sleep of
daily existence—is a craving felt by all persons
possessed of superfluous vitality. This vitality
may be more or less centred on the ego, and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
such,—<i>i.e.</i>, the persons who are possessed of the
largest share of individual, productive vitality,—authorship
and acting are the two shortest ways
of escape from the uniformity of daily life. Of
these two, the last-named form of artistic expression
is best suited to woman, and the woman
who has felt these sensations, especially the tragic
ones, can never tear herself away from the stage.
For she experiences them with an intensity of
feeling which belongs only to the rarest moments
in real life, and which cannot then be consciously
enjoyed. But the artificial emotions, which can
scarcely be reckoned artificial, since they cause
her excited nerves to quiver,—of these she is
strangely conscious in her enjoyment of them;
she enjoys both spiritual and physical horror, she
enjoys the thousand reflex emotions, and she also
enjoys the genuine fatigue and bodily weakness
which follow after. For the majority of women
our life is an everlasting, half-waking expectation
of something that never comes, or it may be nothing
more than a hard day’s work; but life for a
talented actress becomes a double existence, filled
with warm colors—sorrow and gladness. She can
do what other women never can or would allow
themselves to do, she can express every sensation
that she feels, she can enjoy the full extent of a
woman’s feelings, and live them over and over
again. But because this life is half reality and
half fiction, and because the strain of acting is
always followed by a feeling of emptiness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
dissatisfaction, great actresses are always disillusioned,
and that is perhaps the reason why
Duse’s attractive face wears an expression of
weariness and hopeless longing. But the warm
colors—the colors of sorrow and passion—are
always enticing, and that is why great tragedians
can never forsake the stage, although gradually,
little by little, the intensity of their feelings
grows less, and the colors become pale and more
false.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a well-known peculiarity of Norwegian
authors that they all want something. It is
either some of the “new devilries” with which
Father Ibsen amuses himself in his old age, or
else it is the Universal Disarm-ment Act and
the peace of Europe, which Björnson, with his
increasing years and increasing folly, assures us
will come to pass as a result of “universal
morality;” or else it is the rights of the flesh,
which have been discovered by Hans Jaeger;
but whatever they want, it is always something
that has no connection with their art as authors.
All their writings assume the form of a polemical
or critical discussion on social subjects; yet in
spite of their boasted psychology, they care little
for the great mystery which humanity offers to
them in the unexplored regions lying between
the two poles: man and woman; and as for physiology,
they are as little concerned about it as Paul
Bourget in his <i>Physiologie de l’Amour Moderne</i>,
where there is no more physiology than there is
in the novels of Dumas <i>père</i>.</p>

<p>“When the green tree,” etc. That is the style
of the Norwegian authors; and as for the authoresses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
of the three Scandinavian countries,—they
are all ladies who have been educated in the high
schools. They cast down their eyes, not out of
shyness,—for the modern woman is too well aware
of her own importance to be shy,—but in order
to read. They read about life, as it is and as it
should be, and then they set themselves down to
write about life as it is and as it should be; but
they really know nothing of it beyond the little
that they see during their afternoon walks
through the best streets in the town, and at the
evening parties given by the best <i>bourgeois</i>
society.</p>

<p>This is the case with all Scandinavian authoresses,
with one exception. This one exception
can see, and she looks at life with good large
eyes, opened wide like a child’s, and sees with
the impartiality that belongs to a healthy nature;
she can grasp what she sees, and describe it too,
with a freshness and expressiveness which betray
a lack of “cultured” reading.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span> of remarkable and brilliant beauty may
sometimes be seen in the theatre at Copenhagen,
or walking in the streets by the side of a tall,
stout, fair gentleman, whose features resemble
those of Gustavus Adolphus. Any one can see
that the lady is a native of Bergen. To us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
strangers, the natives of Bergen have a certain
something whereby we always recognize them,
no matter whether we meet them in Paris or in
Copenhagen. Björnson’s wife has it as decidedly
as the humblest clerk whom we see on Sundays
at the table of his employer at Reval or Riga.
Their short, straight noses lack earnestness, their
hair is shiny and untidy, their eyes are black as
pitch, and they have the free and easy movements
that are peculiar to a well-proportioned body; it
is as though the essence of the vitality of Europe
had collected in the old Hanseatic town of the
North. I do not think that the inhabitants of
Bergen are remarkable for their superior intelligence;
if they were it might hinder them from
grasping things as resolutely, and despatching
them as promptly as they are in the habit of
doing. But among Norwegians, who are known
to have heavy, meditative natures, the people of
Bergen are the most cheerful and light-hearted,—in
as far as it is possible to be cheerful and
light-hearted in this world.</p>

<p>The lady who is walking by the side of the man
with the Gustavus-Adolphus head is a striking
phenomenon in Copenhagen. She is different
from every one else, which a lady ought never to
be. Compared with the flat-breasted, lively, and
flirtatious women of Copenhagen, she, with her
well-developed figure and large hips, is like a
great sailing-ship among small coquettish pleasure
boats. She is always doing something which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
no lady would do; she wears bright colors, which
are not the fashion; and I saw her one evening at
an entertainment, where there were not enough
chairs, sitting on a table and dangling her feet,—although
she is the mother of two grown-up
sons!</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the woman’s rights movement made its
appearance in Norway, authoresses sprang up as
numerous as mushrooms after the rain. Women
claimed the right to study, to plead, and to legislate
in the local body and the state; they claimed
the suffrage, the right of property, and the right
to earn their own living; but there was one very
simple right to which they laid no claim, and
that was the woman’s right to love. To a great
extent this right had been thrust aside by the
modern social order, yet there were plenty of
Scandinavian authors who claimed it; it was only
amongst the lady writers that it was ignored.
They did not want to risk anything in the company
of man; they did not want any love on the
fourth story with self-cooked meals; they preferred
to criticise man and all connected with
him; and they wrote books about the hard-working
woman and the more or less contemptible
man. The two sexes were a vanquished standpoint.
These were completed by the addition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
beings who were neither men nor women, and, in
consequence of the law of adaptability, they continued
to improve with time, and woman became
a thinking, working, neutral organism.</p>

<p>Good heavens! When women think!</p>

<p>Among the group of celebrated women-thinkers,—Leffler,
Ahlgren, Agrell, etc.,—who criticised
love as though it were a product of the intelligence,
followed by a crowd of maidenly amazons,
there suddenly appeared an author named Amalie
Skram, whom one really could not accuse of
being too thoughtful. It is true that in her first
book there was the intellectual woman and the
sensual man, and a seduced servant girl, grouped
upon the chessboard of moral discussion with a
measured proportion of light and shade,—that
was the usual method of treating the deepest and
most complicated moments of human life. But
this book contained something else, which no
Scandinavian authoress had ever produced before:
her characters came and went, each in his own
way; every one spoke his own language and had his
own thoughts; there was no need for inky fingers
to point the way; life lived itself, and the horizon
was wide with plenty of fresh air and blue sky,—there
was nothing cramped about it, like the
wretched little extract of life to which the other
ladies confined themselves. There was a wealth
of minute observation about this book, brought to
life by careful painting and critical descriptions,
a trustworthy memory and an untroubled honesty;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
one recognized true naturalism below the hard
surface of a problem novel, and one felt that if
her talent grew upon the sunny side, the North
would gain its first woman naturalist who did not
write about life in a critical, moralizing, and
polemical manner, but in whom life would reveal
itself as bad and as stupid, as full of unnecessary
anxiety and unconscious cruelty, as easy-going,
as much frittered away and led by the senses as
it actually is.</p>

<p>Two years passed by and “Constance Ring,”
the story of a woman who was misunderstood,
was followed by “Sjur Gabriel,” the story of a
starving west coast fisherman. There is not a
single false note in the book, and not one awkward
description or superfluous word. It resembles
one of those sharp-cut bronze medallions
of the Renaissance, wherein the intention of the
artist is executed with a perfected technical power
in the use of the material. This perfection was
the result of an intimate knowledge of the material,
and that was Fru Skram’s secret. Her soul
was sufficiently uncultured, and her sense of harmony
spontaneous enough to enable her to reproduce
the simplest cause in the heart’s fibre. She
describes human beings as they are to be found
alone with nature,—with a raw, niggardly, unreliable,
Northern nature; she tells of their never-ending,
unfruitful toil, whether field labor or
child-bearing, the stimulating effect of brandy,
the enervating influence of their fear of a harsh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
God,—the God of a severe climate,—the shy,
unspoken love of the father, and the overworked
woman who grows to resemble an animal more
and more. Such are the contents of this simplest
of all books, which is so intense in its absolute
straightforwardness. The story is told in the
severest style, in few words without reflections,
but with a real honesty which looks facts straight
in the face with unterrified gaze, and is filled
with a knowledge of life and of people combined
with a breadth of experience which is generally
the property of men, and not many men. We
are forced to ask ourselves where a woman can
have obtained such knowledge, and we wonder
how this unconventional mode of thinking can
have found its way into the tight-laced body and
soul of a woman.</p>

<p>A second book appeared the same year, called
“Two Friends.” It is the story of a sailing vessel
of the same name, which travels backwards
and forwards between Bergen and Jamaica, and
Sjur Gabriel’s grandson is the cabin boy on
board. This book offers such a truthful representation
of the life, tone of conversation, and
work on board a Norwegian sailing vessel, that
it would do credit to an old sea captain. The
tone is true, the characters are life-like, and the
humor which pervades the whole is thoroughly
seamanlike. The description of how the entire
crew, including the captain, land at Kingston
one hot summer night to sacrifice to the Black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Venus, and the description of the storm, and the
shipwreck of the “Two Friends” on the Atlantic
Ocean, the gradual destruction of the ship, the
state of mind of the crew, and the captain’s suddenly
awakened piety;—it is all so perfectly life-like,
so characteristically true of the sailor class,
and so full of local Norwegian coloring, that we
ask ourselves how a woman ever came to write
it,—not only to experience it, but to describe it
at all, describe as she does with such masterly
confidence and such plain expressions, without
any affectation, prudery, or conceit, and without
any trace of that dilettantism of style and subject
which has hitherto been regarded as inseparable
from the writings of Scandinavian
women.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Whence</span> comes this sudden change from the
dilettante book, “Constance Ring,” with its
Björnson-like reflections, to the matured style of
“Sjur Gabriel” and “Two Friends”?</p>

<p>I could not understand it all at first, but the
day came when I understood. Amalie Skram as
a woman and an author had come on to the sunny
side.</p>

<p>I have often wondered why it is that so few
people come on to the sunny side. I have studied
life until I became the avowed enemy of all
superficial pessimism and superficial naturalism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
I have discovered a secret attraction between happiness
and individualism,—an attraction deeper
than Zola is able to apprehend; it is the complete
human beings who, with wide-opened tentacles,
are able to appropriate to their own use everything
that their inmost being has need of; but
whether a person is or is not a complete human
being, that fate decides for them before they are
born.</p>

<p>Fru Amalie Skram was, in her way, one of
these complete women. She passed unscathed
through a girl’s education, was perhaps scarcely
influenced by it, and with sparkling eyes and
glowing cheeks she gazed upon the world and
society with the look of a barbaric Northern
woman, who retains the full use of her instinct.
When quite young she married the captain of a
ship, by whom she had two sons. She went with
him on a long sea voyage round the world; she
saw the Black Sea, the Sea of Azof, and the
shores of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. She
saw life on board ship, and life on land,—man’s
life. Her mind was like a photographic plate that
preserves the impressions received until they are
needed; and when she reproduced them, they
were as fresh and complete as at the moment
when they were first taken. These impressions
were not the smallware of a lady’s drawing-room;
they represented the wide horizon, the rough
ocean of life with its many dangers. It was the
kind of life that brings with it freedom from all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
prejudice, the kind of life which is no longer
found on board a modern steamer going to and
fro between certain places at certain intervals.</p>

<p>But it was not to be expected that the monotony
of the life could satisfy her. She separated herself
from her husband, and remained on shore,
where she became interested in various social
problems, and wrote “Constance Ring.”</p>

<p>It was then that she made the acquaintance of
Erik Skram.</p>

<p>The man with the head of Gustavus Adolphus
is Denmark’s most Danish critic. His name is
little known elsewhere, and he cannot be said to
have a very great reputation; but this may be
partly accounted for by the fact that he has no
ambition, and partly because he has one of those
profound natures that are rendered passive by the
depth of their intellect. He is a man of one
book, a novel called “Gertrude Colbjörnson,” and
he is never likely to write another. But he contributes
to newspapers and periodicals, where his
spontaneous talent is accompanied by that quiet,
delicate, easy-going style which is one of the
forms of expression peculiar to the Danish
sceptics.</p>

<p>Fru Amalie Müller became Fru Amalie Skram,
and the bold Bergen woman, who was likewise the
dissatisfied lady reformer of Christiania, became
the wife of a born critic, and went to live at
Copenhagen. She was an excitable little <i>brunette</i>,
he a fair, phlegmatic man, and together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
they entered upon the struggle for the mastery,
which marriage always is.</p>

<p>In this struggle Fru Amalie Skram was beaten;
every year she became more of an artist, more
natural, more simple, more herself, and more of
all that a woman never can become when she is
left to herself. Her husband’s superior culture
liberated her fresh, wild, primitive nature from
the parasites of social problems; the experienced
critic saw that her strength lay in her keen observation,
her happy incapacity for reasoning and
moralizing, her infallible memory for the impressions
of the senses and emotions, and her good
spirits, which are nothing more than the result
of physical health. He cautiously pushed her
into the direction to which she is best suited,
to the naturalism which is natural to her. Her
books were no longer drawn out, neither were
they as poor in substance as books by women
generally are, even the best of them; they grew
to be more laconic than the majority of men’s
books, but clear and vivid; there was nothing in
them to betray the woman. And after he had
done this much for her, the experienced man did
yet one thing more,—he gave her the courage of
her recollections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Amalie</span> Skram’s talent culminated in “Lucie.”
In this book we see her going about in an untidy,
dirty, ill-fitting morning gown, and she is perfectly
at home. It would scandalize any lady.
Authoresses who struggle fearlessly after honest
realism—like Frau von Ebner-Eschenbach and
George Eliot—might perhaps have touched upon
it, but with very little real knowledge of the
subject. Amalie Skram, on the other hand, is
perfectly at home in this dangerous borderland.
She is much better informed than Heinz Tovote,
for instance, and he is a poet who sings of
women who are not to be met with in drawing-rooms.
She describes the pretty ballet girl with
genuine enjoyment and true sympathy; but the
book falls into two halves, one of which has succeeded
and the other failed. Everything that
concerns Lucie is a success, including the part
about the fine, rather weak-kneed gentleman who
supports her, and ends by marrying her, although
his love is not of the kind that can be called
“ennobling.” All that does not concern Lucie
and her natural surroundings is a failure, especially
the fine gentleman’s social circle, into
which Lucie enters after her marriage, and where
she seems to be as little at home as Amalie
Skram herself. Many an author and epicurean
would have hesitated before writing such a book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
as “Lucie.” But Amalie Skram’s naturalism is
of such an honest and happy nature that any
secondary considerations would not be likely to
enter her mind, and in the last chapter the brutal
naturalism of the story reaches its highest pitch.
In the whole of Europe there are only two genuine
and honest naturalists, and they are Emile
Zola and Amalie Skram.</p>

<p>Her later books—take, for instance, her great
Bergen novel, “S. G. Myre,” “Love in North
and South,” “Betrayed,” etc.—are not to be
compared with the three that we have mentioned.
They are naturalistic, of course; their naturalism
is of the best kind; they are still <i>unco in de la
nature</i>, but they are no longer entirely <i>vu à
travers un tempérament</i>. They are no longer quite
Amalie Skram.</p>

<p>Norwegian naturalism—we might almost say
Teutonic naturalism—culminated in Amalie
Skram, this off-shoot of the Gallic race. Compared
with her, Fru Leffler and Fru Ahlgren are
good little girls, in their best Sunday pinafores;
Frau von Ebner is a maiden aunt, and George
Eliot a moralizing old maid. All these women
came of what is called “good family,” and had
been trained from their earliest infancy to live
as became their position. All the other women
whom I have sketched in this book belonged to
the upper classes, and like all women of their
class, they only saw one little side of life, and
therefore their contribution to literature is worthless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
as long as it tries to be objective. Naturalism
is the form of artistic expression best suited
to the lower classes, and to persons of primitive
culture, who do not feel strong enough to eliminate
the outside world, but reflect it as water
reflects an image. They feel themselves in sympathy
with their surroundings, but they have not
the refined instincts and awakened antipathies
which belong to isolation. Where the character
differs from the individual consciousness, they do
not think of sacrificing their soul as a highway
for the multitude, any more than their body—<i>à
la</i> Lucie—to the <i>commune bonum</i>.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seldom happens that a genuine confession penetrates
through the intense loneliness in which a
person’s inner life is lived; with women, hardly
ever. It is rare when a woman leaves any written
record of her life at all, and still more rare when
her record is of any psychological interest; it is
generally better calculated to lead one astray.
A woman is not like a man, who writes about
himself from a desire to understand himself.
Even celebrated women, who are scarce, and
candid women, who are perhaps scarcer still,
have no particular desire to understand themselves.
In fact, I have never known a woman
who did not wish, either from a good or bad
motive, to remain a <i>terra incognita</i> to her own
self, if only to preserve the instinctive element
in her actions, which might otherwise have
perished. There is also another reason for this
reticence. A woman does not live the inner life
to anything like the same extent as a man; her
instincts, occupations, needs, and interests lie
outside herself; whereas a man is more self-contained,—his
entire being is developed from within.
Woman is spiritually and mentally an empty vessel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
which must be replenished by man. She
knows nothing about herself, or about man, or
about the great silent inflexibility of life, until
it is revealed to her consciousness by man. But
the woman of our time—and many of the best
women, too—manifests a desire to dispense with
man altogether; and she whom Nature has destined
to be a vessel out of which substance shall
grow, wishes to be a substance in herself, out of
which nothing can grow, because the substance
wherewith she endeavors to fill the void is unorganical,
rational, and foreign to her nature.
The mistake is tragic, but there is nothing impressive
about it; it is merely hopeless, chaotic,
heart-rending; and because it is chaotic in itself,
it creates a void for the woman who falls into
it,—a void in which she perishes. The more
talented she is, and the more womanly, the
worse it will be for her. And yet it is generally
the talented woman who is most strongly
attracted by it, and man remains to her both
inwardly and outwardly as much a stranger as
though he were a being from another planet.
What can be the origin of this devastating principle
at the core of woman’s being? Among all
the learned and celebrated women whom I have
attempted to depict in this book, there is not
one in whom it has not shown itself, either in a
lasting or spasmodic form; but neither is there
one who did not suffer acutely on account of it.
How did it begin in these women, who were so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
richly endowed, whose natures were so productive?
Was it developed by means of outward
suggestion? Or does it mark a state of transition
between old and new? It is possible that
it is not found only amongst women, but that
there is something corresponding to it in men.
I shall return to this subject afterwards.</p>

<p>Of all the books which women have written
about themselves, I only know of two that are
written with the unalloyed freshness of spontaneity,
and which are therefore genuine to a
degree that would be otherwise impossible; these
are Mrs. Carlyle’s diary and Marie Bashkirtseff’s
journal. The contents of both books consist
chiefly of the cries of despair which issue from
the mouths of two women who feel themselves
captured and ill-used, and are consequently tired
of life, though they do not know the reason nor
who is to blame. Mrs. Carlyle was an imbittered
woman, unwilling to complain of, yet always indirectly
abusing, that disagreeable oddity, Thomas
Carlyle; he was an egotistical boor, who required
everything and gave nothing in return, and was
certainly not the right husband for her. The
two books stand side by side: one is the writing
of a discontented woman of a much older
generation, whose long-suppressed wrath, annoyance,
and indignation, combined with bodily and
spiritual thirst, resulted in a nervous disease;
while the other is far more extraordinary and
difficult to comprehend, as it is the writing of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
young girl who is rich, talented, and pretty, and
who belongs entirely to the present generation of
women, since she would be only thirty-four years
of age were she living now. Both books are
confessions <i>d’outre tombe</i>, and they are both the
result of a desire to be silent,—a desire not
often felt by women.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlyle maintained this silence all her
life long towards her husband, and it was not
until after her death that he discovered, by means
of the diary, how little he had succeeded in making
her happy; his surprise was great. Marie
Bashkirtseff also maintained silence towards an
all too affectionate family, consisting of women
only. They both possessed a strength of mind
which is rare in women, and it was owing to this
that they did not confide their troubles to any
one; theirs was the pride that belongs to solitude,
for they had neither women friends nor confidants,
and it was only when they were no
longer able to contain themselves that some of
their best and worst feelings overflowed into these
books,—in Mrs. Carlyle’s case in a few bittersweet
drops, but with Marie Bashkirtseff they
were more like a foaming torrent filled with thundering
whirlpools, with here and there a few quiet
places where the stream widens out into a beautiful
clear lake, and thin willows bend over the still
waters. The one felt that she had not developed
into a full-grown woman by her marriage; the
other was a young girl who never grew to be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
woman; but both are less interesting on account
of what they tell us than on account of that
which they have not known how to tell. Marie
Bashkirtseff’s book, which in the course of ten
years has run through almost as many editions,
is especially interesting in the latter respect, and
is a perfect gold mine for all that has to do with
the psychology of young girls.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie Bashkirtseff</span> was descended from one
of those well-guarded sections of society from
whence nearly all the women have sprung who
have taken any active part in the movements of
their time during the latter half of our century.
Hers was more than ordinarily happily situated.
The two families from whose union she sprang, the
Bashkirtseffs and Babanins, were both branches of
old South-Russian nobility; but for some reason
or other, which she appears never to have ascertained,
the marriage between her parents was an
unhappy one. They separated after having been
married for a couple of years, during which time
two children, a son and a daughter, were born,
and her mother returned to her old home, accompanied
by little Marie. Petted and spoiled by
her grandparents, her mother, her aunt, and the
governesses, who, even at that early age, were
greatly impressed by her numerous talents and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
determined will, she spent the first years of her
life on her grandparents’ property; but in May,
1870, the whole family went abroad, including the
mother, aunt, grandfather, Marie, her brother, her
little cousin, a family doctor, and a large retinue
of servants.</p>

<p>For two years they wandered from place to
place, staying at Vienna, Baden-Baden, Geneva,
and Paris, and finally settling at Nice. It was
there that Marie, who was then twelve years of
age, began the journal, published after her death
at four-and-twenty, which was to be her real life
work.</p>

<p>She has bequeathed other tokens of her labor
to posterity. They hang in the Luxembourg
museum, in the division reserved for pictures by
artists of the present day which have been purchased
by the State. If we go into one of the
smaller side rooms, we are suddenly confronted
by a picture of dogs barking in a desert place;
there is something so real and vivid about it that
the rest of the State-rewarded industry seems pale
and lifeless in comparison. A bit of nature in
the corner attracts, while it makes us shiver; it
is large, bold, brutal,—and what does it represent?
Only a couple of street urchins talking to
each other as they stand in front of a wooden
paling. There is no doubt but that the influence
of Bastien Lepage has been at work here. There
is something that reminds us of him in the hot,
gray, sunless sky; but there is also a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Russian atmosphere about it that gives a dry look
that contrasts strangely with the French landscapes.
And where would Bastien Lepage get
these contours? We have never seen lines more
carelessly drawn, and yet so true; there is real
genius in them. This picture is a primitive bit
of Russian nature, child-like in its honesty, and
the painter is Marie Bashkirtseff.</p>

<p>Near the door hangs a little portrait of a young
woman dressed in fur. She has the typical Russian
face, with thick, irregular eyebrows, from
under which a pair of Tartar eyes look at you
straight in the face with a curious expression.
What can it be? Is it indifference, or defiance;
or is it nothing more than physical well-being?</p>

<p>Among all the pictures painted by women that
I have ever seen, I do not remember anywhere
the temperament and individuality of the artist
are revealed with greater force. The touch is so
primitive, so uncultured in the best and worst
sense of the word, that it surprises us to think
that it is the work of a woman, half child, who
belongs to the best society; it would seem rather
to suggest the claws of a lioness.</p>

<p>Yet Marie Bashkirtseff was a thorough lady,
not only by birth and education, but in her heart
as well; she was a lady to the tips of her fingers,
to an extreme that was almost absurd; she was
not merely a fashionable lady, in the way that
certain clever young men take a half ironical
pleasure in appearing fashionable, but a lady in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
real earnest, with all the intensity of a religious
bigot.</p>

<p>She had been educated by ladies, by a gentle
and refined though rather shallow mother, by an
aunt whose vocation seems to have consisted in
self-sacrifice for others, a domineering grandmother,
two governesses,—one Russian and the
other French,—and an “angelical” doctor who
lived in the house, and always travelled with
them, and who seems to have become somewhat
of a woman himself from having lived amongst so
many women.</p>

<p>She was no more than twelve years old when
she discovered that her governesses were insupportably
stupid, and that the only thing that
they understood was how to make her waste her
precious youth. There was no time for that.
She was already aware of the shortness of time,
and it was her anxiety to make the most of it that
afterwards hurried her short life to its close. She
was possessed of an intense thirst for everything,—life,
knowledge, enjoyment, sympathy. But
although her grandfather had been “Byronic” in
his youth, the family passed their lives vegetating
with true Russian indolence; there was no
help for it; she knew that nothing better was
to be expected of them. And accordingly she
hunted her governesses out of the house and took
her education into her own hands. A tutor was
engaged, and a list was made from which no
branch of learning was excluded. The tutor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
nearly fainted with astonishment when it was
shown to him, but he was still more astonished
at Marie’s progress afterwards. Drawing was
the only lesson in which the future great artist
did not succeed; it bored her, and nothing came
of it.</p>

<p>Her inner life, meanwhile, is stirred with
tumultuous passions. She is in love, as passionately
and as truly in love as any matured
woman. And, after all, this thirteen-year-old
girl is a matured woman; she is more developed,
more truly woman-like than the worn-out woman
of three-and-twenty, who only lived with half her
strength. The man whom she loves is a very distinguished
Englishman, who had bought a villa
at Nice, where he spent a few months with his
mistress every year,—but this circumstance does
not affect Marie in the very least; she is experienced
in her knowledge of the world, and by no
means bourgeois in her way of thinking. There
is another reason, however, that causes her intolerable
suffering,—the handsome English duke
is too grand for her. She is troubled, not only
because he pays her no attention at present, but
because she thinks that he is never likely to
esteem her sufficiently to wish to marry her,
unless, indeed, she could do something to make
herself a name, and become celebrated. Marie
Bashkirtseff, accordingly, wishes to become celebrated.
She would like to be a great singer, who
is at the same time a great actress; she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
like to have the whole world at her feet, including
the duke, and be able to choose between royal
dukes and princes, and then she would choose
him. For a couple of years or more she lives
upon this dream, studies, reads, cries, and suffers
that unnecessary overplus of secret pain and
anxiety which usually accompanies the development
of richly gifted natures.</p>

<p>She has a lovely voice and great dramatic
talent, but the former is not fully developed, and
cannot be trained for some years to come. She
buys cart-loads of books; but as there is no one
to guide her choice, and her social intercourse
does not diverge a hairbreadth outside her family
and a small circle of friends, consisting chiefly
of compatriots, it is only natural that her reading
should be confined to Dumas <i>père</i>, Balzac, Octave
Feuillet, and such literary tallow candles as
Ohnet, and others like him. Her taste remains
uncultivated, her horizon bounded by the family,
and her knowledge continues to be a mixture of
ancient superstitions combined with the newest
shibboleths.</p>

<p>Her most familiar converse is between herself
and her Creator, whom her imagination pictures
as a kind of superior great-grandfather, very grand
and powerful, and the only One in whom she can
confide. To Him she lays bare her heart, beseeching
Him to give her that which is a necessity
of life to her, and she makes numerous
promises, to be fulfilled only on condition that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
her prayers are granted; she respects what she
conceives to be His wishes with regard to prayer
and almsgiving, and overwhelms Him with reproaches
if these are of no avail. And they are
of no avail. Her voice, which has been tried
and praised by the highest musical authorities in
Paris, is being gradually undermined by a disease
of the throat, and the duke marries; thus her
hopes of becoming famous and of gaining a great
love are gone, gone forever.</p>

<p>Those were the first and second cruel wounds
wherewith life made its presence felt in this sensitive
soul; they were wounds which never healed,
and which imparted hidden veins of venom to the
healthy parts of her being.</p>

<p>Does not this remind us of the fairy tale about
wounds that never heal? Is not this just the
way that the wounds made by Fate, or by human
beings, in our souls continue to bleed forever?
They are like tender places, which shrink from
the touch throughout a lifetime, and wither if a
breath passes over them. The more sensitive a
person is, the more painful they are, and nothing
is so easily wounded as a growing organism.
The nerves have a good memory, better even
than the brain, and there are some wounds received
in youth and impressed during growth
which seem to have been wiped out ages ago, till
suddenly they present the appearance of a putrefying
spot, a poisonous place, the point of disintegration
of the entire organism. Or there may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
be something crippled in the person’s vitality.
They live on, but one muscle, perhaps only a
very small one, is strained and just a little out
of order, and the soul is compelled to replace
what the body lacks by means of extra exertion,
which is afterwards paid for by excessive
weariness.</p>

<p>There are some sluggish natures, especially
among women, who exert their strength to the
least possible degree, and do their work in a
half-hearted manner. There are also souls which
seem all aglow with the psychic and sensuous
warmth of their natures, who carry the whole
substance of their being in the hand, and who
give themselves up entirely to the interest of
what they are feeling and wishing for at the
moment. Their path is strewn with fragments
of their life, which fall off dead, and every stroke
aimed at them hits the heart. Their soul has no
covering to protect them from disappointment;
neither have they the forgetful sleep of animals,
wherein the body is at rest. But such natures
are generally possessed of an endless supply of
self-sustaining strength, which imbues them with
the power to grow again; and although their
wounds are plentiful, their germinating cells are
plenteous also. The parts that are crippled
remain crippled still, but new possibilities are
continually developing in new directions.</p>

<p>The young girl of whose silly, half-fancied
love story I have made so much, was one of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
natures. She was formed of the material out of
which destiny either moulds women who become
the greatest of their sex, or else casts them aside,
discarded and broken. It generally depends upon
some very trifling matter which of the two takes
place. Marie was an exceedingly spoiled child
when the first blow fell; but there was something
lacking in her nature—a dead spot that revealed
itself with the destruction of her voice—while
her body was blossoming into womanhood. There
was a dead spot somewhere without as well, something
that lacked in life, else it were not possible
to long so ardently and not obtain. There was
something that gazed at her with evil, ghost-like
eyes, causing her nerves to quiver beneath its
icy breath. She was a brave girl. She did not
complain, did not look back, but drew herself
together, silent and determined. Her passionate
love of work took the form of painting, and as
she could not become a great singer, she meant
to be a great painter. But a part of her being
congealed and withered away; her young heart
had expanded to receive a return of the love it
had so freely given, and was left unsatisfied.</p>

<p>The years passed in much the same way as they
had passed before for this spoiled child of fortune.
A few people who were indifferent to her
died, and others came who were no less indifferent.
They travelled from Nice to Paris, and
from Paris to Nice, but she was equally lonely
everywhere. She had no playfellows, no girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
friends, no school-room companions, and to life’s
contrasts she remained a stranger. Her cousin
Dina was the only one who was always with her,
and she was the typical girl,—a pretty, good-natured
nonentity. And thus, though always
lonely, she was never alone. Wherever she
went, her mother and aunt went with her, and
wherever they did not go, Marie Bashkirtseff did
not go either. In all her journeyings, she never
received a single impression for herself alone; it
was always reflected at the same moment in the
sun-glasses of her aunt and mother, and never a
word did she hear but was also heard by her
duennas. No man was allowed within the circle
of her acquaintance until he had first been judged
suitable from a marriageable, as well as a social
point of view. The female atmosphere by which
she was surrounded paralyzed every other.</p>

<p>It was her destiny!</p>

<p>Life was empty around her, and in the void
her excited nerves became even more and more
centred upon her own ego. Her opinion of herself
assumed gigantic proportions, and whatever
there had been of soul grandeur in her nature
was changed into admiration of self. And yet,
in spite of all, this girl, who was undoubtedly a
genius, never realized her own power to the full.
The natural nobility of her feelings assumed a
moral, bourgeois dress, and her young senses,
which had manifested such a passionate craving
at their first awakening, withered and grew numb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>She was sixteen when she experienced her
second disappointment in love, and it became
for her the turning-point of her inner life.</p>

<p>At her earnest request the family had gone to
Rome. It was the time of the Carnival, and
after the conventional life at Nice, the sudden
outbreak of merriment in the Eternal City called
forth a frivolous mood in every one. There was
something delightful in the ease with which acquaintances
were made, and the simple, straightforward
manner in which homage was done. A
young man makes love to Dina; he belongs to
an old, aristocratic, Roman family, and is the
nephew of an influential cardinal. Marie entices
him away from her, and the young Italian falls a
prey to the brilliant fascination and wild coquetry
of her manner. He is dazzled by such aggressive
conduct on the part of so young a girl, and
the equivocal character of it spurs him on. He
storms her with declarations of love, and Marie
reciprocates his passion,—not very seriously
perhaps, but her senses, her vanity, her pride, all
are on fire. The young man communicates to
her something of his habitual good spirits, and
her head, no less than the heads of her mother
and aunt, is completely turned at the prospect of
such a distinguished <i>parti</i>. The family set to
work in good earnest to bring matters to a climax,
for which object they employ suitable deputies,
while Marie persistently holds the legitimate
joys of marriage before the face of her importunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
lover. The Italian slips past these dangerous
rocks with the dexterity of an eel. He knows
what Marie and the house of Bashkirtseff, convinced
as they are of the grandeur of their Russian
ancestry, cannot realize,—that for him, the
heir and nephew of the cardinal, no marriage will
be considered suitable unless it brings with it
connection with the nobility, or the advantages
of an immense fortune; and in this opinion he
fully concurs. The result is that they are always
at cross purposes: he talks of love, she of marriage;
he of <i>tête-à-têtes</i> on the staircase after midnight,
she of betrothal kisses between lunch and
dinner under the auspices of her family. When
his allusions to his uncle’s disapproval of a marriage
with a heretical Russian lady from the
provinces do not produce any effect on the
family other than indignation, expressive of their
wounded feelings, he goes away, and allows himself
to be sent into retreat in a monastery.
While there, he ascertains that the Bashkirtseffs
have left Rome and given up all desire to have
such a vacillating creature for a son-in-law. They
go to Nice, and no more is said about him until
Marie persuades her family to return to Rome,
where she meets him at a party, but only to discover
that he loves her when there, and forgets
her again the moment that she is out of sight.
This was the second time that she had knocked at
the door of life; and, as on the former occasion,
Fate held back the joys which she seemed to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
in store, only opening the door wide enough to
let in the face of a grinning Punchinello.</p>

<p>Few writers have attempted to describe the
state of a young girl’s mind on such occasions,
when a thousand cherished hopes are instantaneously
charred as though struck by lightning, and,
worse still, all that she had wished for becomes
hateful in her eyes, and the shame of it assumes a
gigantic scale, and continues to increase, though
maybe at the cost of her life. Men have no suspicion
of this, and they would find it hard to
understand, even supposing that they were given
the opportunity of observing it. They grow up
amid the realities of life; a girl, in the unreal.
The disappointments which a man endures are
real ones, and unless he is a fool, he is in a
position to form an approximate valuation of his
own importance. With a girl it is different; her
opinion of herself is exaggerated to an extent
that is quite fantastical and altogether unreal,
and this is especially the case when her education
is of a strictly conventional character, and
has been conducted mainly by women. The
preservation of her purity is the foundation of
her creed, but she is not told, nor does she guess,
wherein this purity consists, nor how it may be
lost; and consequently she imagines that it can
be lost in every conceivable way,—by a mere
nothing, by a pressure of the hand, but in any
case by a kiss. This kiss Marie Bashkirtseff
had actually given and received, and after it she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
had been forgotten and despised! That kiss
branded her in secret all her life. She never
forgot it.</p>

<p>This is not the only consequence of the change
from the real to the unreal which takes place
when the outer world casts its reflection in the
mirror of a young girl’s soul. Every girl has an
exaggerated idea of the value of the mystic purity
of her maidenhood in the eyes of men; and when
she makes a man happy by the gift of herself,
she imagines that she has given him something
extraordinary, which he must accept on bended
knee. What words can describe the humiliation
which she feels if he does not set a sufficiently
high value on the gift, or if he thrusts it aside
like a pair of old slippers that do not fit! All
girls are silly to a certain extent, even the
cleverest; and the girl who is not silly on this
point must have lost something of her girlish
modesty.</p>

<p>In the case of Marie Bashkirtseff, a part of her
being was blighted after her encounter with the
Italian, and she never entirely recovered from the
effects of it. This, her first acquaintance with a
man, was so full of racial misunderstandings and
others besides, that it destroyed her faith in man,
as indeed it is doomed to be destroyed sooner
or later in every girl with a strong individuality
and healthy nature. And for her, as for many
another, followed the lifeless years into the
middle of the twenties, when a new and very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
different faith begins to show itself as the result
of wider views of life and internal changes. But
with her this faith never came. Her vitality
gave way too soon. Those dead years which
must inevitably follow upon an all too promising
and too early maturity, leaving a young woman
apparently trivial and devoid of any true individuality
of character, and which often last until the
thirties, when the time comes for a new and
greater change,—those years with Marie, as with
many another “struggling” girl, were filled with
an unnatural craving for work.</p>

<p>She wanted to be something on her own
account, as an individual. She compelled her
mother and aunt to go with her to Paris, where
she could go to Julian’s studio, which was the
only one for women where painting was taught
seriously. The working hours were from eight
to twelve, from one to five.</p>

<p>But she worked longer. This spoiled child,
who had never known what it meant to exert herself,
was not satisfied with eight hours of hard
labor. She works in the evenings as well, after
she comes home; she works on Sundays; she is
dead to the world, and with the exception of her
daily bath, she renounces every luxury of the
toilet, and succeeds in condensing into two years
the work of seven. One day Julian tells her that
she must work alone, “because,” he says, “you
have learned all that it is possible to teach.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie Bashkirtseff</span> was not born an artist, with
that stern predestination with which nature determines
the career of persons with one talent. If
her voice had not been destroyed during its
development, she would in all probability have
become one of those great singers whose charm
lies not only in the outward voice, but in the
indescribable fascination of a deep, strong individuality.
Her journal, especially the first part,
reveals an authoress with a rare psychological
intuition, an understanding of human nature, a
deep sympathy, a mastery of expression, and an
early-matured genius, which are unsurpassed even
among Russians, well known for the richness of
their temperament. If this young woman, whose
short life was consumed by a craving for love,
had gained the experience she so greatly desired,
where would the woman be found who could have
borne comparison with her? Who like her was
created to receive the knowledge whereby a
woman is first revealed to herself, and is developed
into the being who is earth’s ruler,—the
great mother, on whose lap man reposes, and from
whence he goes forth into the world? All that
she had was original; it was all of the best material
that the earth has to give; and therein lay
the mystery of her downfall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>The backbone of her nature was that indomitable
pride whereby a great character reveals
the consciousness of its own importance. The
lioness cannot wed with the house-dog. The same
instinct which, in animals, marks the boundary
line between the different species, determines in
a still higher degree—higher far than the materialistic
wisdom of our schools will allow—the
attractions and antipathies of love. The iron
law which compels healthy natures to preserve
their distinction, prevented this girl from sinking
to the level of the men of her own class,
amongst whom she might have found some to
love her. She tried it more than once, but it did
not answer. Her exceptionable nature required
a husband superior to herself. One or two such
men might be found nowadays, who not only as
productive minds, but also in the subtle charm
of their manly characters, would have been the
born masters of an enchantress such as Marie
Bashkirtseff. But these men are not to be met
with in the drawing-rooms and studios of Paris,
nor yet in the Bois de Boulogne; not in St. Petersburg
either, nor on the family estates of Little
Russia, and she never got to know them.</p>

<p>This woman, who was born to become a great
singer, a great painter, a great writer, born—before
all else—to be loved with a great love,
never learned to know love, and died without
being great in any way, because she was enchained
all her life long to that which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
greater than all her possibilities,—a young girl’s
infinite ignorance.</p>

<p>In spite of all the knowledge that she had
acquired, in spite of all the probings of her sensitive
nerves and sharp intellect, she remained
always and in everything incomplete. It is one
of the results of the incompleteness of which
unmarried women are the victims, that they seek
everywhere the complete, the perfected in man,—<i>i.e.</i>,
they seek for that which is only to be found
in men who are growing old, and have nothing
more to give; in whom there are no slumbering
ambitions, and no hidden aspirations. She must
have passed by, unheeding, many a young genius,
who perhaps went to an inferior woman to satisfy
the passion which might have proved to both of
them an endless source of blessedness, health,
and regeneration. She must have felt many a
look rest upon her, arousing sensations which, to
her white soul, were a mystery. For this girl,
who had drunk deeply of the literature of her
time, and who knew theoretically everything that
there was to know, was yet unspoiled by a single
trace of premature knowledge. The pages of her
journal are innocent from beginning to end,—an
innocence that is stupid while it is touchingly
intact. Marie Bashkirtseff’s journal is not merely
a contribution to the psychology of girls, it is a
young girl’s psychology in the widest, most typical
sense,—the psychology of the unmarried
state, bequeathed by one who is ignorant to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
who know, as her only memorial upon earth, but
a memorial that will last longer than marble or
bronze. She died young, but she had no wish to
die. She took twelve years to write this book,
and she wrote it on her travels, in the midst of
her pleasures, in the midst of her work, in the
despair of her loneliness, and in her fear when
she shrank from death; she wrote it during
sleepless nights, and on days passed in blessed
abstraction in the beauties of nature. She always
addressed the unknown hearers who were ever
present to her imagination; she spoke to them so
that, in case she should die young, she might live
upon earth in the memory of the strangers who
happened to read her journal. A “human document,”
by a young girl, she thought, must be of
sufficient interest not to be forgotten, and she
promises to tell us everything connected with
her little person. “All, all,—not only all her
thoughts, but she will not even hide what is
laughable and disadvantageous to herself; for
what would be the object of a book like this,
unless it told the truth absolutely, accurately,
and without concealment?”</p>

<p>The confessions are by no means a human document
in the sense that her three patron saints—Zola,
Maupassant, and Goncourt—would have
used the word. They do not contain a single
naked reality. They are modest, not only with
the modesty of a child of nature, but with the
modesty of a young hot-house beauty, a delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
lady of fashion, beneath whose snow-white
resplendent dress—the work of a Parisian dressmaker—are
concealed the bleeding wounds and
the pitiless signs of death. But she lets us follow
her from the rich beginnings of her youth
onwards, until the stream of life trickles away
drop by drop, leading us on to the weary resignation
of her last days.</p>

<p>This exhaustion begins to show itself immediately
after the two years of reckless overwork
and study in Julian’s studio; but the cause of it
was mental rather than physical. Julian’s last
words were: “You have learned all that it is possible
to teach—the rest depends upon yourself.”
And Robert-Fleury, the principal academical professor,
nodded his approval. After that they left
her. But where was she to begin? Where was
the rest to come from? What was she to do—she,
who had been such a phenomenal pupil?
How was she to obtain sufficient individuality
for original production? Learn! yes, of course.
A girl can do that better than the most painstaking
young man of the faculty. There is nothing
to prevent it; her sex will slumber as long as
the brain is kept at work. But artistic production
is another matter. Whence should it come?
Not from herself, for she has nothing; she has
had no experience. She can represent what she
has seen, or she can imagine, but that is all.
Marie’s nature was too truthful to be satisfied
with imitation. The old academical art did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
appeal to her, as was very natural, and the new
was just bursting its shell, and contained all the
impurity and rubbish that belongs to a state of
transition. The imperfect in her desired the
perfect; she who was an incomplete woman felt
the need of a perfected man.</p>

<p>She made no progress. She painted at home
from models, and she went out driving with her
maid, accompanied by some young Russian
friends, and sketched street scenes from the carriage.
So great was her need for ideas that she
attempted pictures on religious and historical
subjects, and with some difficulty she finished a
picture for the next Salon,—went half mad with
empty pride, but had to admit that it was very
much inferior to the former one which she had
painted under Julian’s supervision. For two
years she meets with no success. Her pictures
contain nothing that is characteristic; she has
no individual style, no personal experiences, and
no original ideas. But her individuality, though
dormant, is too strong to allow her to imitate
the style of other lady artists, one half of whom
are too amateurish, and their painting too devoid
of character, to content her, while the others
have betrayed their sex, and adopted a severe,
masculine style.</p>

<p>At last the day came when Bastien Lepage was
a public celebrity. Marie Bashkirtseff saw his
pictures, became his pupil, worshipped him, and
ever after sang his praises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Yet, in all this, there was something lacking.</p>

<p>His bright coloring, and the atmosphere of
his landscapes, with their pale, sultry heat, the
aggressive physical character of his people, etc.,—all
these points appealed strongly to her South-Russian
nature. He set free her national feelings,
which had hitherto been bound and suppressed
beneath academical influences, and she discovered
a kindred spirit in him, a primitive element at
the root of his being, which made her tenderly
disposed towards him. But she had no intention
of remaining his pupil. She was too deeply conscious
of the difference between them, and saw
clearly that his influence was not likely to be
more than a passing phase.</p>

<p>She worshipped him from a long-suppressed
desire to worship some one, but her worship was
calm and passionless. This little Bastien Lepage
was not the man to arouse her deepest affections;
he was too bourgeois, and his fine art was too
tame.</p>

<p>And yet she praised him, half mechanically.
Saint Marceaux, the sculptor, had appealed to
her feelings more deeply than he had done.</p>

<p>There was a reason for it. There was a strong
tie between these two beings, who seemed only
destined to exert a passing influence over one
another.</p>

<p>They were both ill when they made each other’s
acquaintance: life, with its deceptive pleasures,
had ruined the health of Bastien Lepage; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Marie Bashkirtseff was ill from want of life,—her
youth, her beauty, her vitality, had all been
wasted.</p>

<p>It is the usual fate of the cultured young
people of our time: he comes to her ruined,
because he has satiated his thirst; she comes to
him ruined, because her thirst has never been
satisfied.</p>

<p>They are as far apart as two separate worlds,
and they do not understand one another.</p>

<p>The development of the last few years, through
which Marie Bashkirtseff had passed before she
met Bastien Lepage, had brought her and the
readers of her journal nothing but pain and
dulness.</p>

<p>What with ambitious plans for artistic work,
and the life with her family,—which resembled
a convent more than anything else, interrupted
by occasional smart dinners, balls, and various
projects of worldly marriages, which came to
nothing,—Marie Bashkirtseff had become superficial
and almost stupid. Her genius appeared
to have flown, and a sickly, <i>blasée</i> hot-house
plant, solely occupied with herself, was all that
remained of her. She was like the ordinary girl
of good family, who has grown rather disagreeable,
and is no longer quite young, who is still
ignorant of most things, and becomes extremely
tiresome by chattering on subjects which she
does not understand. All this is changed after
her meeting with Bastien Lepage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>She regains her youth in a wonderful way; she
becomes shy and easily bewildered. When he
pays his first visit she gets quite confused, turns
back three times before entering the drawing-room,
and cannot think of anything to say after
they have shaken hands. But he, with his unaffected
manner, and little insignificant person,
soon succeeds in putting her at her ease. The
long tirades in her journal come to an end at
last, and are followed by short, cautious, but very
expressive sentences.</p>

<p>Bastien Lepage is anything but a lover. His
manner is straightforward and simple, and he
holds himself strikingly aloof, maybe for want
of practice in the art of love-making, or perhaps
out of sheer weariness.</p>

<p>When he leaves her, she becomes as vain and
egotistical as before; but when he is there she
watches his every movement with a still, calm
joy.</p>

<p>She had been ill for several years. One lung
was affected, and now the other followed suit;
she also suffered from deafness, and that troubled
her more than anything else. She had never
given a thought to her health.</p>

<p>When Bastien is there, all is well. She is
always able to hear what he says, and in his eyes
she is always pretty; her art takes a new turn,
and inspired by him she becomes original. The
result is the picture in the Luxembourg, called
“A Meeting,” besides several very good portraits.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
There is no question of love between
them; he is never anything but the artist, and
her old coquettish manner vanishes. She has
a peculiarly tender affection for him, and the
development from a self-centred girl to a full-grown
woman is accomplished within her.</p>

<p>He suddenly becomes violently and hopelessly
ill. He is seized with violent pains, followed by
the cramp, and his legs are paralyzed.</p>

<p>The green bud of her love withers without
ever having blossomed. But as his illness grows
worse, his longing to have Marie always beside
him increases. When he is sufficiently free from
pain to go out driving, he gets his brother to
carry him up to her; and at other times she comes
with her mother to visit him. It is quite a little
idyl. His mother, a worthy woman of the working-class,
cooks his soup; while her mother, who
is a smart lady, cuts his hair, which has grown
too long, and his brother, the architect, crops his
beard. After their united efforts he looks as
handsome as ever, and no longer so ill. Then
Marie must sit by his bedside, while he turns his
back upon the others and looks only at her,—and
speaks of art.</p>

<p>It is September, 1884. Marie coughs and
coughs. Bastien is getting worse and worse,
and he cannot bear her to leave him, even while
he is undergoing his worst paroxysms of pain.
On the 1st of October she writes in her journal:</p>

<p>“<i>Tant de dégoût et tant de tristesse!</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“What is the use of writing?</p>

<p>“Bastien Lepage is getting worse and worse.</p>

<p>“And I cannot work.</p>

<p>“My picture will not be finished.</p>

<p>“Alas! Alas!</p>

<p>“He is dying and suffers a great deal. When
one is with him, one seems to have left the world
behind. He is already beyond our reach, and
there are days when the same feeling comes over
me. I see people, they talk, and I answer; but
I seem to be no longer on the earth,—a quiet
indifference, not painful, almost like an opium
dream. And he is dying! I go there more from
habit than anything else; he is a shadow of his
former self, and I, too, am scarcely more than a
shadow; what is the good of it all?</p>

<p>“He is hardly conscious of my presence now;
there is little use in going; I have not the power
to enliven him. He is contented to see me, and
that is all.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is dying, and it is all the same to
me; I do not take myself to account for it; it is
something that cannot be helped.</p>

<p>“Besides, what difference does it make?</p>

<p>“All is over.</p>

<p>“In 1885 they will bury me.”</p>

<p>In that she was mistaken, for she died the
same month. Until the last few days Bastien
Lepage had himself carried up to her; and she,
shaken by the fever of the last stage of consumption,
had her bed moved into the drawing-room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
where she could receive him. There, by her
bedside, as she had formerly sat beside his, with
his legs resting upon a cushion, he remained
until the evening. They scarcely spoke; they
were together, and that was all they cared for.
And she, who ever since her first awakening consciousness
had yearned so passionately and so
impatiently for permission to live her life, died
now, silent, resigned, without a murmur; and
knowing that the end was near, she was great in
death, since she had not succeeded in being great
in her short life.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> remained of her? A book of a thousand
pages, of which, in ten years, nearly ten thousand
copies were sold, which André Theuriet provided
with an introductory poem written in his best
style, and to which Maurice Barrès dedicated an
altar built by himself and sanctified a rather mistaken
Marie Bashkirtseff cult. There was also
“A Meeting” in the Luxembourg, which, according
to Marie Bashkirtseff’s own report, Bastien
Lepage criticised as follows: “He says that it is
comparatively easy to do <i>choses canailles</i>, peasants,
street urchins, and especially caricatures; but to
paint beautiful things, and to paint them with
character,—there is the difficulty.”</p>

<p>In order to complete the sketch of this girl, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
which I have tried especially to accentuate the
typical element, I should like to let her speak for
herself, with her characteristic expressions, her
impulsive views and peculiar temperament.</p>

<p>At the age of thirteen, she writes:—</p>

<p>“My blood boils, I am quite pale, then suddenly
the blood rises to my head, my cheeks
burn, my heart beats, and I cannot remain quiet
anywhere; the tears burn within me, I force them
back, and that only makes me more miserable;
all this undermines my health, ruins my character,
makes me irritable and impatient. One
can always see it in a person’s face, whether
they take life quietly. As for me, I am always
excited. When they deprive me of my time for
learning, they rob me for the whole of my life.
When I am sixteen or seventeen, my mind will
be occupied with other thoughts; now is the
time to learn.”</p>

<p>And afterwards, with a depth of understanding
worthy of Nietzsche:—</p>

<p>“All that I say is not original, for I have no
originality. I live only outside myself. To walk
or to stand still, to have or not to have, it is
all the same to me. My sorrows, my joys, my
troubles do not exist....”</p>

<p>And again:—</p>

<p>“I want to live faster, faster, fast.... I am
afraid it is true that this longing to live with the
speed of steam foretells a short life....”</p>

<p>“Would you believe it? To my mind everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
is good and beautiful, even tears, even
pain. I like to cry, I like to be in despair,
I like to be sad. I like life, in spite of all. I
want to live. I long for happiness, and yet I
am happy when I am sad. My body cries and
shrieks; but something in me, which is above
me, enjoys it all.”</p>

<p>Then this simile, drawn with wonderful
delicacy:—</p>

<p>“At every little sorrow my heart shrinks into
itself, not for my own sake, but out of pity—I
do not know whether anybody will understand
what I mean—every sorrow is like a drop of ink
that falls into a glass of water; it cannot be
obliterated, it unites itself with its predecessors
and makes the clear water gray and dirty. You
may add as much water as you like, but nothing
will make it clear again. My heart shrinks into
itself, because every sorrow leaves a stain on my
life, and on my soul, and I watch the stains
increasing in number on the white dress which
I ought to have kept clean.”</p>

<p>At the age of fourteen she wrote these prophetic
words:—</p>

<p>“Oh! how impatient I am. My time will
come; I believe it, yet something tells me that
it will never come, that I shall spend the whole
of my life waiting, always waiting. Waiting
... waiting!”</p>

<p>When she was sixteen, at the time of the incident
with the cardinal’s nephew:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“If I am as pretty as I think, why is it that no
one loves me? People look at me! They fall in
love! But they do not love me! And I do so
want to be loved.”</p>

<p>At seventeen, the first entry in her journal for
that year:—</p>

<p>“When shall I get to know what this love is of
which we hear so much?”</p>

<p>Later on:—</p>

<p>“Very much disgusted with myself. I hate
all that I do, say, and write. I despise myself,
because not a single one of my expectations has
been fulfilled. I have deceived myself.</p>

<p>“I am stupid, I have no tact, and I never had
any. I thought I was intellectual, but I have no
taste. I thought I was brave; I am a coward. I
believed I had talent, but I do not know how
I have proved it.”</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen:—</p>

<p>“My body like that of an antique goddess, my
hips rather too Spanish, my breast small, perfectly
formed, my feet, my hands, my child-like
head. <i>À quoi bon?</i> When no one loves me.</p>

<p>“There is one thing that is really beautiful,
antique: that is a woman’s self-effacement in
the presence of the man she loves; it must be
the greatest, most self-satisfying delight that a
superior woman can feel.”</p>

<p>In 1882, at the beginning of her illness:—</p>

<p>“So I am consumptive, and have been so for
the last two or three years. It is not yet bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
enough to die of it.... Let them give me ten
years longer, and in these ten years, fame or love,
and I shall die contented, at the age of thirty.”</p>

<p>The following year:—</p>

<p>“No, I never was in love, and I never shall be
any more; a man would have to be very great to
please me now, I require so much....</p>

<p>“And simply to fall in love with a handsome
boy,—no, it would not answer. Love could no
longer wholly occupy me now; it would be a
matter of secondary importance, a decoration to
the building, an agreeable superfluity. The idea
of a picture or a statue keeps me awake for nights
together, which the thought of a handsome man
has never done.”</p>

<p>In another place:—</p>

<p>“Whom shall I ask? Who will be truthful?
Who will be just?”</p>

<p>“You, my only friend, you at least will be
truthful, for you love me. Yes, I love myself,
myself only.”</p>

<p>Two weeks before her death, after a visit from
Bastien Lepage:—</p>

<p>“I was dressed entirely in lace and plush, all
white, but different kinds of white; Bastien
Lepage opened his eyes wide with joy.</p>

<p>“‘If only I could paint!’ he said.</p>

<p>“‘And I!’</p>

<p>“Obliged to give it up,—the picture for this
year!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>Her portrait represents the face of a typical
beauty of Little Russia; the firm, dark eyebrows,
arched over eyes that are far apart, give
the face an expression that is peculiarly honest
and straightforward. The eyes gaze fixedly and
dreamily into the distance; the nose is short,
with nostrils slightly distended, the mouth soft
and determined, with the upper lip passionately
compressed. The face is round as a child’s, and
the neck short and powerful, on a squarely built,
fully developed body.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> latter half of our century is comparatively
poor in remarkable women. Nowadays, when
women are more exacting than they used to be,
they are of less importance than of old. We
have rows of women artists, women scientists,
and authoresses; the countries of Europe are
overrun with them, but they are all mediocrities;
and in the upper classes, although there are
plenty of eccentric ladies, they are abnormities,
not individuals. The secret of a woman’s power
has always lain in what she is, rather than in
what she does, and that is where the women of
to-day appear to be strangely lacking. They do
all kinds of things, they study and write books
without number, they collect money for various
objects, they pass examinations and take degrees,
they hold meetings and give lectures, they start
societies, and there never was a time when women
lived a more public life than at present. Yet,
with all that, they are of less public importance
than they used to be. Where are the women
whose drawing-rooms were filled with the greatest
thinkers and most distinguished men of their
day? They do not exist. Where are the women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
with delicate tact, who took part in the affairs of
the nation? They are a myth. Where are the
women whose influence was acknowledged to be
greater than the counsel of ministers? Where
are the women whose love is immortalized in
the works of the greatest poets? Where are the
women whose passionate devotion was life and
joy to man, bearing him on wings of gladness
towards the unknown, and leading him back to
the beautiful life on earth? They have been,
but where are they now? The more that woman
seeks to exert her influence by main force, the
less her influence as an individual; the more she
imbues this century with her spirit, the fewer
her conquests as woman. Her influence on the
literature of the eighties has shown itself in an
intense, ingrained hatred. It is she who has
inspired man to write his hymn of hatred to
woman,—Tolstoi in the “Kreutzer Sonata,”
Strindberg in a whole collection of dramas,
Huysman in “En Ménage,” while many a lesser
star is sceptical of love; and in the writings of
the younger authors, where this scepticism is not
so apparent, we find that they understand nothing
at all about women. It is a peculiar sign of
the times that, in spite of the many restrictions
of former days, men and women never have stood
wider apart than at present, and have never
understood one another more badly than now.
The honest, unselfish sympathy, the true, I should
like to say organical union, which is still to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
observed in the married life of old people, seems
to have vanished. Each goes his or her own way;
there may be a nervous search for each other
and a short finding, but it is soon followed by a
speedy losing. Is it the men who are to blame?
The men of former days were doubtless very
different, but in their relations to women they
were scarcely more sociable than at present.</p>

<p>Or is it the women who are at fault? For some
time past I have watched life in its many phases,
and I have come to the conclusion that it is the
woman who either develops the man’s character
or ruins it. His mother, and the woman to whom
he unites himself, leave an everlasting mark upon
the impressionable side of his nature.</p>

<p>In most cases the final question is not, What
is the man like? but, What kind of a woman is
she? And I think that the answer is as follows:
A woman’s actions are more reasonable than they
used to be, and her love is also more reasonable.
The consequence is a lessening of the passion
that is hers to give, which again results in a
corresponding coolness on the part of the man.
The modern system of educating girls by teaching
them numerous languages, besides many other
branches of knowledge, encourages a superficial
development of the understanding, and renders
women more exacting, without making them more
attractive; and while the average level of intelligence
among women is raised, and the self-conceit
of the many largely increased, the few who are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
original characters will in all probability disappear
beneath the pressure of their own sex, and
in consequence of the apathy which governs the
mutual relations of both sexes.</p>

<p>The age in which we live has produced another
class of women in their stead, who, since they
represent the strongest majority, must be reckoned
as the type. It is natural that they should have
neither the influence nor the fascination of the
older generation, and they are not as happy.
They are neither happy themselves, nor do they
make others happy; the reason is that they are
less womanly than the others were. From their
midst the modern authoresses have gone forth,
women who in days to come will be named in
connection with the progress of culture; and I
think that Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler, Duchess
of Cajanello, will long be remembered as the most
characteristic representative of the type.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> was the supporter of a movement that originated
with her, and ceased when she died. She
was known in countries far beyond her native
Sweden; her books were read and discussed all
over Germany, and her stories were published in
the <i>Deutsche Rundschau</i>. She had a clearer brain
than most women writers; she could look reality
in the face without being afraid, and indeed she
was not one who was easily frightened. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
very independent, and understood the literary side
of her calling as well as its practical side, and her
struggles were by no means confined to her writings.
She threw aside the old method of seeking
to gain her ends by means of womanly charm; she
wanted to convince as a woman of intellect. She
condemned the old method which used to be considered
the special right of women, and fought
for the new right, <i>i.e.</i>, recognition as a human
being. All her arguments were clear and temperate;
she was not emotional. The minds from
which she fashioned her own were Spencer and
Stuart Mill. Nature had endowed her with a
proud, straightforward character, and she was
entirely free from that affected sentimentality
which renders the writings of most women
unendurable.</p>

<p>In the course of ten years she became celebrated
throughout Europe, and she died suddenly
about six months after the birth of her first child.
Sonia Kovalevsky, the other and greater European
celebrity, who was Professor of Mathematics, and
her most intimate friend, also died suddenly, as
did several others,—Victoria Benediktson (Ernst
Ahlgren), her fellow-countrywoman, and for many
years her rival; Adda Ravnkilde, a young Danish
writer, who wrote several books under her influence;
and a young Finnish authoress named
Thedenius. The last three died by their own
hands; Sonia Kovalevsky and Fru Edgren-Leffler
died after a short illness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>Fru Leffler was the eldest,—she lived to be
forty-three; the others died younger,—the last two
very much younger. But they all made the same
attempt, and they all failed. They wanted to
stand alone, they demanded their independence,
they tried to carry into practice their views with
regard to man.</p>

<p>George Sand made the same attempt, and she
succeeded. But then her independence took a
very different form from theirs. She followed
the traditions of her family, and set no barriers
to love; she drank of the great well of life until
she had well-nigh exhausted it. She was quite
a child of the old <i>régime</i> in her manner of life.
The efforts made by these other women, at the
close of the nineteenth century, took the form of
wishing to dispense with man altogether. It is
this feature of Teutonic chastity, bounding on
asceticism, that was the tragic moment in the
lives of all these short-lived women.</p>

<p>It is a strange piece of contemporary history of
which I am about to write. It is this that is the
cause of the despondent mood peculiar to the last
decade of our century; it is this that acts as a
weight upon our social life, that makes our leisure
wearisome, our joys cold. It is this decay in
woman’s affection that is the greatest evil of the
age.</p>

<p>One of the tendencies of the time is the craving
for equality, which seeks to develop woman’s
judgment by increasing her scientific knowledge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
It might have answered from the woman’s point
of view, so far, at least, as the man was concerned,
for it does not much matter to a woman
whom she loves, as long as she loves some one.
But women have become so sensible nowadays
that they refuse to love without a decisive guarantee,
and this calculating spirit has already
become to them a second nature to so great an
extent that they can no longer love, without first
taking all kinds of precautionary measures to
insure their future peace and comfortable maintenance,
to say nothing of the unqualified regard
which they expect from their husbands.</p>

<p>All things are possible from a state of mind
such as we have described, except love, and love
cannot flourish upon it. If there is a thing for
which woman is especially created,—that is,
unless she happens to be different from other
women,—it is love. A woman’s life begins and
ends in man. It is he who makes a woman of
her. It is he who creates in her a new kind of
self-respect by making her a mother; it is he who
gives her the children whom she loves, and to
him she owes their affection. The more highly
a woman’s mind and body are developed, the less
is she able to dispense with man, who is the
source of her great happiness or great sorrow, but
who, in either case, is the only meaning of her
life. For without him she is nothing.</p>

<p>The woman of to-day is quite willing to enjoy
the happiness which man brings, but when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
reverse is the case, she refuses to submit. She
thinks that, with a little precaution, she can
bring the whole of life within the compass of a
mathematical calculation. But before she has
finished her sum, and proved it to see if it is
correct, happiness and sorrow have flown past her,
leaving her desolate and forsaken,—hardened for
want of love, miserable in spite of a cleverly calculated
marriage, and imbittered in the midst of
joyless ease and sorrow unaccounted for.</p>

<p>Such was the fate of these five short-lived
authoresses, although they might not have described
it as I have done. Anne Charlotte
Edgren-Leffler was chief among the Scandinavian
women’s rights women who have made for themselves
a name in literature. Her opinions were
scattered abroad among thousands of women in
Germany and in the North, and as she died without
being able to dig up the seed which she had
sown, she will always be considered as a type of
the <i>fin de siècle</i> woman, and will remain one of its
historical characters.</p>

<p>I write this sketch in the belief that it will not
be very unlike the one she would have written of
herself, had she lived long enough to do so.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne Charlotte Leffler</span> was born at Stockholm,
and, like all her townsfolk, she was tall,
strong, and somewhat angular. She was by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
nature cold and critical, and in this respect she
did not differ from the women of North Sweden.
The daughter of a college rector, she had received
a thoroughly good education, and was probably far
better educated than the majority of women, as
she grew up in the companionship of two brothers,
who were afterwards professors.</p>

<p>When she was nineteen years of age, she published
her first work, a little play, in two acts,
called “The Actress.” The piece describes the
struggle between love and talent, and the scene is
laid in the rather narrow sphere of a small country
town. The characters are decidedly weak, but
not more so than one would naturally expect from
the pen of an inexperienced girl of the upper
class. There was nothing to show that it was
the work of a beginner. Her faculty for observation
is extraordinarily keen, her descriptions of
character are terse, striking, and appropriate, and
the construction of the piece is clever. It shows
a thoughtful mind, and there is none of the clumsy
handling noticeable in young writers; the conflict
is carefully thought out, and described with
mathematical clearness. But however ornate an
author’s style, however remarkable her intellect,
these qualities do not form the most important
part of her talent as a woman and an authoress.
In considering the first book of a writer who afterwards
became celebrated throughout Europe, the
question of primary importance is this: How much
character is revealed in this book?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>Or, to put the question with greater precision,
since it concerns a woman: How much character
is there that the author was not able to suppress?</p>

<p>The sky seems colored with the deep glow of
dawn; it is the great expectancy of love. Here
we have the writing of a young girl who knows
nothing about love except the one thing,—that it
is a woman’s whole existence. She has never
experienced it, but her active mind has already
grasped some of its difficulties; and one great
difficulty, which must not be overlooked, is the
bourgeois desire to maintain a sure footing. An
actress is going to marry into a respectable middle-class
family. Nobody in this section of society
can think of love otherwise than clad in a white
apron and armed with a matronly bunch of keys.
Love here means the commonplace. The actress
is accustomed to a worse but wider sphere; love
for her means to become a great actress, to attain
perfection in her art, but to her intended it means
that she should love him and keep house.</p>

<p>The problem does not often present itself like
this in real life, and if it did the result would in
all probability be very different; in the imagination
of a well-bred girl of eighteen, like Anne
Charlotte Leffler, it was the only conclusion possible.
And as he will not consent to her wishes,
and she refuses to give way to his; as he has no
desire to marry an actress, and she no intention of
becoming a housewife, they separate with mutual
promises of eternal platonic love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>The end is comic, but it is meant to be taken
seriously. No matter how it begins, the ordinary
woman’s book always ends with platonic love; and
it is very characteristic of Anne Charlotte Leffler
that her first play should have a platonic and not
a tragic ending.</p>

<p>The tragic element, which generally assumes
supernatural proportions in the imagination of the
young, did not appeal to her; her life was placed
in comfortable, bourgeois surroundings, and she
was perfectly contented with it.</p>

<p>We find the same want of imagination in all the
Swedish authoresses, from Fru Lenngren, Frederica
Bremer, and Fru Flygare-Carlén onwards.</p>

<p>A few years later Anne Charlotte Leffler wrote
a three-act play, called “The Elf,” of which the
two first acts afford the best possible key to her
own psychology. It was acted for the first time
in 1881, but it was probably written soon after
her marriage, in 1872, with Edgren, who was at
that time in the service of the government.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Fru Edgren</span> was one of those proud, straightforward
women who would never dream of allowing
any one to commiserate them. She made no
attempt to suit her actions to please the world;
her sole ambition was to show herself as she
really was. When she wished to do a thing, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
did it as quickly as possible, and without any one’s
help. She wrote under the influence of her personal
impressions, her personal judgment, and her
personal opinions; whatever she might attain to
in the future, she was determined to have no one
but herself to thank for it. But she was a woman.
Though usually possessed of a clear judgment,
she did not sufficiently realize what it means for
a woman to enter upon a literary career by herself.
She succeeded in her literary career; but in
doing so she sacrificed the best part of her life,
and was obliged to suppress her best and truest
aspirations, thereby destroying a large amount of
real artistic talent.</p>

<p>There are few things that afford me more genuine
pleasure than the books of modern authors.
I enjoy them less on account of what they tell
me than for that which they have been unable
to conceal. When they write their books, they
write the history of their inner life. You open a
book and you read twenty lines, and in the tone
and character of those twenty lines you seem to
feel the beating of the writer’s pulse. In the
same way as a fine musical ear can distinguish a
single false note in an orchestra, a fine psychological
instinct can discern the true from the
false, and can tell where the author describes
his own feelings and where he is only pretending—can
discern his true character from among the
multitude of conscious and unconscious masks,
and can say: This is good metal, and that a worthless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
composition, wherewith he makes a dupe of
himself and of others.</p>

<p>The woman who attempts to write without a
man to shield her, to throw a protecting arm
around her, is an unfortunate, incongruous being.
That which sets her soul aglow—which calls
loudly within her—she dare not say. When a
man wishes to be a great writer, he defies conventionalism
and compels it to become subservient
to him; but for a lonely woman, conventionalism
is her sole support, not only outwardly, but
inwardly also. It forms a part of her womanly
modesty; it is the guide of her life, from which
naught but love can free her; that is why the
more talented a woman is, the more absolutely
love must be her pilot.</p>

<p>Fru Edgren’s best play and her two most interesting
stories are “The Elf,” “Aurora Bunge,”
and “Love and Womanhood.” None of her other
works can be said to equal these in depth of feeling,
and none strike a more melancholy note.
There is an emotional, nervous life in them
which presents an attractive contrast to the cold
irony of her other works. She has put her whole
being into these writings, with something of her
womanly power to charm; while in the others we
meet with the clear insight, the critical faculty,
and the rare sarcasm to which they owe their
reputation.</p>

<p>Yet in these three works we notice how very
much she is hedged in on all sides by conventionalism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
“The Elf,” “Love and Womanhood,”
and “Aurora Bunge” make us think of a large
and beautiful bird that cannot fly because its
long, swift wings have been broken by a fall
from the nest.</p>

<p>The “elf” is the wife of the respected mayor
of a small country town. Her father was a
Swedish artist, whose whole life was spent in
travelling, because every time that he came home
he was driven away by the narrow social life of
Sweden. When he is lying on his deathbed, he
leaves his penniless child to the care of his
younger friend, the Mayor, who knows no better
way of providing for her than by making her his
wife. He is universally considered the best son,
the best partner in business, and the best man—in
the town. The elf wanders about the woods,
and becomes the subject of much gossip, likewise
of envy, among the smart ladies of the town.</p>

<p>One evening when they are giving a party, and
she forgets to play the part of hostess, their
neighbor, a Baron, arrives with his sister. Both,
no longer young, free from illusions, liberal in
thought and speech, seem to carry with them a
breath from a bigger world; their mere presence
serves to make the elf thoughtlessly happy, and
from henceforward she sits daily to the Baron for
a picture representing Undine when the knight
carries her through the wood, and her soul awakes
within her. The elf’s soul—<i>i.e.</i>, love—is also
awakened. She feels herself drawn towards this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
man, who has sufficient fire to awaken her womanhood
with a kiss. She does not wish, she does
not think, but she would not like to be separated
from him; he lives in an atmosphere that suits
her, and in which she thrives. She is still a
child; but the child would like to wake. It is
true that her conscience reproaches her with
regard to the Mayor, but here the circumstances
are related as though she were not quite married,—that
is a mistake which nearly all Teutonic
authoresses make.</p>

<p>The Baron tells her the story of Undine. The
knight finds her at the moment when the brook
stretches forth his long white arm to draw her
back, but he does not let her go; he takes her in
his arms and carries her away, and she looks up
at him with a half anxious expression—there is
something new in this expression. She is no
longer Undine. She loves. She has a soul.</p>

<p>In this drama, Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler,
the future leader of the woman’s rights movement,
makes the confession that a woman’s soul
is—love. She is the only Swedish woman writer
who would have owned as much.</p>

<p>The Baron is a decadent. Fru Edgren took
this type from real life long before the decadence
made its appearance in literature. He had enjoyed
all sensations with delight and inner emotion,
until the woman in the elf opens her eyes in the
first moment of half consciousness, and when that
happens she becomes indifferent to him. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
passion cools. It is true that his actions still
tend in the same direction, but he is able to gaze
at his thoughts critically. He is not the knight
who lifts Undine out of the cold water. He
leaves her lying in the brook.</p>

<p>Among the experiences by means of which
“independent” women, with a “vocation,” awake
to womanhood, this is probably the most common.
It is very difficult to define their feelings
when they realize a change in the man who first
aroused their affections; but I think that I am
not far wrong in saying that it is something akin
to loathing. The more sensitive the woman, and
the more innocent she is, the longer the loathing
will last. However cold her outward behavior
may appear, the feeling is still there.</p>

<p>There is nothing that a woman resents more
keenly than when a man plays with her affections,
and neglects her afterwards. The more inexperienced
the woman, the more unmanly this behavior
seems. If she is a true woman, her disappointment
will be all the greater; she will feel it not
only with regard to this single individual, but it
will cast a shadow over all men.</p>

<p>The last act reveals the author’s perplexity.
From an æsthetic point of view the ending is
cold, and to a certain extent indifferently executed;
but judged from a psychological point of
view, it is thoroughly Swedish. Considered as
the writing of a young lady in the year 1880, it
must be confessed that the dialogue is tolerably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
strong, even <i>piquante</i>; but in order to please the
highly respected public, it is necessary for the
play to end well.</p>

<p>Suddenly they one and all—in this land of
pietism and sudden conversion—beat their breasts
and confess their sins. The Mayor examines
himself, and repents that he was selfish enough
to marry the elf; his mother repents because she
cared more for her son than her daughter-in-law;
the elf repents because she almost allowed herself
to be betrayed into falling in love; and the
Baron’s sister, who, throughout the piece, has
always held aloft the banner of love and liberty,
repents in a general way, without any particular
reason being given. Thus everything returns to
its former condition, and Undine remains in the
duck-pond.</p>

<p>With this satisfying termination, “The Elf”
survived a large number of performances.</p>

<p>The question which suggests itself to my mind
is: Whether the author intended the piece to end
in this manner? Or was the original ending less
conventional, and was Fru Edgren obliged to
alter it in order that the play might be acted?
What else could she do? A lonely woman like
her dared not sin against the public morals. It
were better to sin against anything else, only
not against the public morals; for in that case
they would have condemned her to silence, and
her career would have been at an end. The keynote
of the piece was the yearning to escape from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
the long Swedish winters and the gossip by the
fireside, out into the fresh air, into the light and
warmth of the South.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ten</span> years afterwards Fru Edgren returned to
the same problem in “Love and Womanhood,”
and this time she treated it with greater delicacy
and more depth of feeling.</p>

<p>The heroine is no longer the traditional elf,
but the modern girl,—nervous, sensitive, with a
sharp intellect and still sharper tongue; she is
very critical, very reserved, full of secret aspirations,
and very warm-hearted; her heart is
capable of becoming a world to the man she
loves, but it needs a man’s love to develop its
power of loving. She loves an elegant, self-satisfied
Swedish lieutenant, who has served as a
volunteer in Algiers, and has written a book on
military science; he is just an ordinary smart
young man, and he takes it for granted that she
will accept him the instant he proposes. But
she refuses him. He is indignant and hurt; he
cannot understand it at all, unless she loves some
one else. But no, she does not love any one
else. Then what is the reason? She is sure
that he does not care enough for her; there is
such an indescribable difference between her love
for him, or rather the love that she knows herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
capable of feeling, and the affection that he
has to offer her, that she will not have him on
any account, and looks upon his proposal almost
in the light of an insult. He goes away, and
returns, soon afterwards, engaged to a little
goose.</p>

<p>Fru Edgren develops an elaborate theory, to
which she returns again and again. According
to her, it is only the commonplace little girls
of eighteen, innocence in a white pinafore, with
whom men fall in love. I myself do not think
that there is much in it: a dozen men who are
nonentities fall in love with a dozen young
women who are likewise nonentities. On the
other hand, we have that numerous type, which
includes the modern girl, full of soul, originality,
and depth of character, clever and modest, possessed
of a keen divination with regard to her
own feelings and that of others, mingled with a
chaste pride that is founded upon the consciousness
of her own importance,—a pride that will
not accept less than it gives. And these girls
are confined to the narrow circle to which all
women are reduced, to two or three possibilities
in the whole course of their long youth, possibilities
which chance throws in their way, and
which are perhaps no possibilities at all to them.
A few years pass by, and these girls have become
stern judges upon the rights of love, and they
have developed a bitter expression about the
mouth, and a secret gnawing in the soul. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
few years more, and this unappreciated womanly
instinct will have brought them to hate men.</p>

<p>Fru Edgren went the same way. In her
“Sketches from Life” we find some traces of
this feeling in the stories where she displays the
comparative worth of men and women; take, for
instance, the tale called “At War with Society.”
But before she had quite joined the army of stern
judges, she weighed the problem of love once
more, in the second of her five completed novels,
called, “Aurora Bunge.”</p>

<p>For the last ten years Aurora Bunge has been
chief among the ball beauties of Stockholm.
Everything in her life is arranged and settled
beforehand. In the winter she goes to balls,
night after night, to parties and plays; in the
summer she is occupied in much the same way
in a fashionable watering-place. For the last
ten years she has known exactly with whom she
is going to dance, what compliments will be paid
her, what offers she will receive, and whom she
is eventually going to marry. The marriage can
be put off until she is thirty—and now she is
nearly thirty, and the time has come. She is
one of those girls who have danced and danced
until everything has grown equally indifferent
and wearisome to them; and yet she is without
experience, and is likely to remain so to the end.
She allows herself perfect freedom of speech, but
she will never allow herself a single free action.
A couple of intrigues in the dim future are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
entirely excluded from her plans, but what difference
will that make? She has something of
Strindberg’s “Julie,” but without the latter’s
perversity; she is also some years in advance of
her. She would have no objection to eloping
with a circus rider, or doing something <i>de très
mauvais goût</i>, but she knows that she will never
do it. The summer previous to the announcement
of her engagement she is seized with a fit
of liking the country, and she accompanies her
mother to one of her properties, which is situated
on a desolate part of the coast. It is the first of
her thirty summer visits that is not quite <i>comme
il faut</i>. In a sudden outburst of enthusiasm for
nature, she spends days and weeks wandering
about in the woods and fields, with torn dress
and down-trodden shoes, and goes out sailing
with the fishermen. She becomes stronger and
more beautiful, and is more than ever imbued
with an indescribable longing. This vague
longing leads her on towards that which she is
going to experience—which is to be her life’s
only experience. She feels her pulses beat and
her heart burn within her, and not till then does
the matured woman of thirty tear aside the bandage
that binds her eyes; and looking out, she
cries: Where art thou, who givest me life’s fulness?
On one of her boating expeditions, she
goes to the nearest lighthouse. The lighthouse-keeper,
a strong, quiet young man, comes out.
She looks, and she knows that it is he!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>Up to this point Fru Edgren has copied the
secret writing in her own soul, and every touch
is true. But her experience went no further.
The part that follows is psychological and logical
too, but it has the greatest fault that a romance
can have; <i>i.e.</i>, it is word for word imagined,
not experienced, and for this reason it is overdrawn.
Aurora has scarcely landed before a
storm sets in. She flutters like an exhausted
bird, in and out of the narrow lighthouse. The
lighthouse-keeper sees the danger, and hurries
down. She wants to throw herself into the
water. He climbs down the rocks and seizes
hold of her. Already before, this son of the
people had found time to give her a love poem
to read. The storm lasts three days, and for
three days she remains there. On the fourth
day the fishermen return to fetch her, and the
lighthouse-keeper is furious. By this time she
is no better than a very ordinary fisher girl. She
is deathly pale, but insists on leaving him. He
threatens her with his fists, and she proposes
that they should drown themselves together; but
his mother had already drowned herself, and he
does not wish to have two suicides in the family.
Aurora goes home, and they never meet again.
A few months afterwards she marries an officer
who is in debt.</p>

<p>Fru Edgren’s men may be divided into two
types,—the one she cannot endure, but she
describes him admirably; the other she cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
describe at all, but she likes him very much
indeed. The first is the fashionable man of
Stockholm society, who has tasted life’s pleasures,
and is wearied of them; the second is the
simple, unsophisticated son of the people.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Fru Edgren</span> looked life boldly in the face.—life,
which was continually passing her by, because
she was a lady, whose duty it was to lead
a blameless existence. She was by this time a
celebrated authoress, with a comfortable income,
but what had she gained by it? Merely this:
that envious eyes watched her more narrowly
than before, and that she was expected to live
for the honor and glory of Sweden, and for the
honor and glory of her position as a woman
writer. Yet, after all, were they not in the
North? And was she not allowed all possible
freedom up to a certain point? Even this certain
point might be overstepped sometimes,—in
private, of course,—and such was the general
usage. But she was one of those proud natures
who will not tolerate a greasy fingermark on the
untarnished shield of their honor, and she was
also one of those sovereign natures whose will
is a law to themselves.</p>

<p>We are confronted by a strange sight in Scandinavian
literature. We find man’s laxity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
woman’s prudery existing side by side. Björnson,
Ibsen, Garborg, Strindberg, were contemporaries
of Fru Edgren, and their renown was at its
height. The eighties were the great period of
Scandinavian romance, and this romance turned
solely upon the problem of man and woman.
The productive enthusiasm of those days drove a
multitude of women into the fields of literature,
including those whom we have mentioned, who
died early, and some lesser ones, who still continue
to lead a useless, literary existence. But
their writings are strangely poor compared with
those of the men, even though there were
numbered amongst them an Edgren-Leffler, an
Ahlgren, and a Kovalevsky. The men were not
afraid; they all had something to impart, and
that which they imparted was themselves. But
there was not a single woman’s voice to join in
the mighty chorus of the hymn to love; not one
of them had experienced it, and they had nothing
to say. Their longing kept silence. When, however,
the literature of indignation, with Kalchas
Björnson at its head, broke loose against the
corruptions and depravity of men, then all the
authoresses raised their voices, and instituted a
grand inquisition.</p>

<p>Fru Edgren took part in it. What hymn could
she sing? She had no experience of love, and
her patience was at an end. Towards the end
of the eighties, love had completely vanished
from her books, and its place had been filled by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
the question of rights,—women’s rights with
regard to property and wage-earning, and marriage
rights. “The Doll’s House” was followed
by a deluge of books on unhappy marriages, and
Fru Edgren contributed to increase their number.
In a play called “True Women,” she contrasts
the hard-working, wage-earning woman
with the indolent, extravagant man; while she
severely condemns the woman who so far lowers
herself as to love a husband who has been unfaithful
to her. She is, in fact, so badly disposed
towards love that she allows an honest,
hard-working man, in the same piece, to be
refused by an honest, hard-working woman, and
for the simple reason that superior people must
no longer propose, nor allow others to propose
to them.</p>

<p>Her drama, “How People do Good,” is written
in the same mood. “The Gauntlet” and “The
Doll’s House” have exerted such a great influence
over her that she has unconsciously quoted
whole sentences. She has become no better than
the ordinary platform woman; her former sense
and good taste are no longer to be observed in
her writings, and even socialism has a place in
her programme. This woman, who knows nothing
of the proletarian, represents him in a melodramatic
manner, as she has done before with
the son of the people. She travels about the
country and fights for her rights; she becomes a
propagandist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>It was at this time that the celebrated mathematician,
Sonia Kovalevsky, was appointed to
the high school at Stockholm at the instigation of
Fru Edgren’s brother, Professor Mittag-Leffler,
and the two women became the greatest of friends.
Sonia Kovalevsky had practiced the principles of
women’s rights and asceticism in her own married
life, and was now, after her husband had
shot himself, a widow.</p>

<p>She was probably Björnson’s model in more
than one of his books, and she combined Russian
fanaticism with the Russian capacity to please.
She had not been long at Stockholm before
the war broke loose. Strindberg raged against
women, ignoring Fru Edgren and others on the
plea that they could not be reckoned as women,
since they had no children. Björnson and Fru
Edgren were everywhere welcomed at women’s
meetings as the champions of women’s rights.</p>

<p>For four or five years Sonia Kovalevsky and Fru
Edgren were almost inseparable. Fru Edgren
took back her maiden name of Leffler after her
separation from her husband. The two friends
were always travelling. They went to Norway,
France, England, etc., together, and Fru Leffler
wrote her longest novel, “A Tale of Summer.”
It was the old problem of love and the artistic
temperament. A highly gifted artist falls in
love with a commonplace schoolmaster,—she
nervous, refined, independent; he young, big,
strong, true-hearted, and very like a trusty Newfoundland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
dog. It does not answer. An artist
must not marry, the most learned of Newfoundland
dogs cannot understand an artist, and yet
artists have a most unfortunate preference for
Newfoundland dogs.</p>

<p>There was something in this novel that was
not to be found in any of her earlier works,—a
hasty, uneven beat of the pulse, something of the
fever of awakened passion.</p>

<p>Sonia, meantime, was engaged with her work
for the <i>Prix Bordin</i>; but she had scarcely begun
her studies before she left them to devote herself
to a parallel romance, about which she was very
much excited. It was called “The Struggle for
Happiness: How it Was, and How it Might
Have Been.” She persuaded Fru Leffler to give
this thought a dramatic setting, and she was very
anxious to have it published. It was nothing
more or less than a hymn to love, which had fast
begun to set flame to her ungovernable Russian
blood. Fru Leffler wrote the piece, but it proved
an utter failure.</p>

<p>On her travels she made the acquaintance of
the Duke of Cajanello, a mathematician, who was
probably introduced to her by Sonia Kovalevsky
He was professor at the Lyceum at Naples, and
Fru Leffler appears to have fallen suddenly and
passionately in love. Her last novel bears witness
to this fact; like the former one, it treats of
“Love and Womanhood,” but here the proof of
true womanliness lies in the loving. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
divorced from her husband and went to Italy.
Liberty, love, and the South,—all were hers at
last.</p>

<p>She had something else besides to satisfy her
ambition as a society lady, when, in May, 1890,
she became the Duchess of Cajanello. After her
marriage she paid a visit to Stockholm with her
husband, and every one thought that she looked
younger, more gentle, more womanly, and happier
than she had ever done before.</p>

<p>After the marriage, her friendship with Sonia
Kovalevsky was at an end. The latter had not
found happiness in loving, and she died in the
year 1891.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Cajanello lived at Naples, and
in her forty-third year she experienced for the
first time the happiness of becoming a mother.
When she died, the little duke was scarcely more
than six months old. Up to the last few days of
her life, she was to all appearances happy and in
good health. Her last work was the life of her
friend Sonia Kovalevsky. In writing it she fulfilled
the promise which they had made, that
whichever of the two survived should write the
life—a living portrait it was to be—of the other.
She had just begun to correct the proofs before
she died. On the last day before her illness, she
worked till three o’clock in the afternoon at a
novel called “A Narrow Horizon,” which was left
unfinished. She died after a few days’ illness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>Fru Edgren-Leffler belonged to that class of
women whose senses slumber long because their
vital strength gives them the expectation of long
youth. But when the day comes that they are
awakened, the same vitality that had kept them
asleep overflows with an intensity that attracts
like a beacon on a dark night. It is the woman
who attracts the man, not the reverse. Fru
Edgren-Leffler found in her fortieth year that
which she had sought for in vain in her twentieth
and thirtieth,—love! The unfruitful became
fruitful; the emaciated became beautiful;
the woman’s rights woman sang a hymn to the
mystery of love; and the last short years of
happiness, too soon interrupted by death, were a
contradiction to the long insipid period of literary
production.</p>

<p class="ph1">By GERTRUDE HALL,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Author of “Far from To-day,” “Allegretto,” “Verses,” etc.</i></p>

<p class="ph1">16mo. Cloth. Price, $1.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>Miss Gertrude Hall’s second volume of short stories, “Foam of the Sea and
Other Tales,” shows the same characteristics as the first, which will be instantly
remembered under the title of “Far from To-day.” They are vigorous, fanciful, in
part quaint, always thought-stirring and thoughtful. She has followed old models
somewhat in her style, and the setting of many of the tales is mediæval. The
atmosphere of them is fascinating, so unusual and so pervading is it; and always
refined are her stories, and graceful, even with an occasional touch of grotesquerie.
And there is an underlying subtleness in them, a grasp of the problems of the
heart and the head, in short, of life, which is remarkable; and yet they, for the
most part, are romantic to a high degree, and reveal an imagination far beyond
the ordinary. “Foam of the Sea,” like “Far from To-day,” is a volume of rare
tales, beautifully wrought out of the past for the delectation of the present.</p>

<p>Of the six tales in the volume, “Powers of Darkness” alone has a wholly nineteenth
century flavor. It is a sermon told through two lives pathetically miserable.
“The Late Returning” is dramatic and admirably turned, strong in its
heart analysis. “Foam of the Sea” is almost archaic in its rugged simplicity,
and “Garden Deadly” (the most imaginative of the six) is beautiful in its
descriptions, weird in its setting, and curiously effective. “The Wanderers” is a
touching tale of the early Christians, and “In Battlereagh House” there is the
best character drawing.</p>

<p>Miss Hall is venturing along a unique line of story telling, and must win the
praise of the discriminating.—<i>The Boston Times.</i></p>

<p>There is something in the quality of the six stories by Gertrude Hall in the
volume to which this title is given which will attract attention. They are stories
which must—some of them—be read more than once to be appreciated. They
are fascinating in their subtlety of suggestion, in their keen analysis of motive,
and in their exquisite grace of diction. There is great dramatic power in
“Powers of Darkness” and “In Battlereagh House.” They are stories which
should occupy more than the idle hour. They are studies.—<i>Boston Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>She possesses a curious originality, and, what does not always accompany this
rare faculty, skill in controlling it and compelling it to take artistic forms.—<i>Mail
and Express.</i></p>

<p class="ph1"><i>16mo. Cloth. Price, $1.00.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_decoline.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">THESE stories are marked with originality and power. The titles
are as follows: viz., Tristiane, The Sons of Philemon, Servirol,
Sylvanus, Theodolind, Shepherds.</p>

<p>Miss Hall has put together here a set of gracefully written tales,—tales of long
ago. They have an old-world mediæval feeling about them, soft with intervening
distance, like the light upon some feudal castle wall, seen through the openings of
the forest. A refined fancy and many an artistic touch has been spent upon the
composition with good result.—<i>London Bookseller.</i></p>

<p>“Although these six stories are dreams of the misty past, their morals have a
most direct bearing on the present. An author who has the soul to conceive such
stories is worthy to rank among the highest. One of our best literary critics, Mrs.
Louise Chandler Moulton, says: ‘I think it is a work of real genius, Homeric in
its simplicity, and beautiful exceedingly.’”</p>

<p>Mrs. Harriet Prescott Spofford, in the <i>Newburyport Herald</i>:—</p>

<p>“A volume giving evidence of surprising genius is a collection of six tales by
Gertrude Hall, called ‘Far from To-day.’ I recall no stories at once so powerful and
subtle as these. Their literary charm is complete, their range of learning is vast, and
their human interest is intense. ‘Tristiane,’ the first one, is as brilliant and ingenious,
to say the least, as the best chapter of Arthur Hardy’s ‘Passe Rose;’ ‘Sylvanus’
tells a heart-breaking tale, full of wild delight in hills and winds and skies, full of
pathos and poetry; in ‘The Sons of Philemon’ the Greek spirit is perfect, the
story absolutely beautiful; ‘Theodolind,’ again, repeats the Norse life to the echo,
even to the very measure of the runes; and ‘The Shepherds’ gives another reading
to the meaning of ‘The Statue and the Bust.’ Portions of these stories are told
with an almost archaic simplicity, while other portions mount on great wings of
poetry, ‘Far from To-day,’ as the time of the stories is placed; the hearts that
beat in them are the hearts of to-day, and each one of these stories breathes the joy
and the sorrow of life, and is rich with the beauty of the world.”</p>

<p>From the <i>London Academy</i>, December 24th:—</p>

<p>“The six stories in the dainty volume entitled ‘Far from To-day’ are of imagination
all compact. The American short tales, which have of late attained a wide and
deserved popularity in this country, have not been lacking in this vitalizing quality;
but the art of Mrs. Slosson and Miss Wilkins is that of imaginative realism, while
that of Miss Gertrude Hall is that of imaginative romance; theirs is the work of
impassioned observation, hers of impassioned invention. There is in her book a
fine, delicate fantasy that reminds one of Hawthorne in his sweetest moods; and
while Hawthorne had certain gifts which were all his own, the new writer exhibits
a certain winning tenderness in which he was generally deficient. In the
domain of pure romance it is long since we have had anything so rich in simple
beauty as is the work which is to be found between the covers of ‘Far from
To-day.’”</p>

<p class="ph2">THE WEDDING GARMENT.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="ph3"><span class="antiqua">A Tale of the Life to Come.</span></p>

<p class="ph3">BY LOUIS PENDLETON.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p class="ph1"><i>16mo. Cloth, price, $1.00. White and gold, $1.25.</i></p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>“The Wedding Garment” tells the story of the continued existence of a young
man after his death or departure from the natural world. Awakening in the
other world,—in an intermediate region between Heaven and Hell, where the
good and the evil live together temporarily commingled,—he is astonished and
delighted to find himself the same man in all respects as to every characteristic of
his mind and ultimate of the body. So closely does everything about him
resemble the world he has left behind, that he believes he is still in the latter
until convinced of the error. The young man has good impulses, but is no saint,
and he listens to the persuasions of certain persons who were his friends in the
world, but who are now numbered among the evil, even to the extent of following
them downward to the very confines of Hell. Resisting at last and saving himself,
later on, and after many remarkable experiences, he gradually makes his way
through the intermediate region to the gateways of Heaven,—which can be found
only by those prepared to enter,—where he is left with the prospect before him
of a blessed eternity in the company of the woman he loves.</p>

<p>The book is written in a reverential spirit, it is unique and quite unlike any
story of the same type heretofore published, full of telling incidents and dramatic
situations, and not merely a record of the doings of sexless “shades” but of
<i>living</i> human beings.</p>

<p>The one grand practical lesson which this book teaches, and which is in
accord with the divine Word and the New Church unfoldings of it everywhere
teach, is the need of an interior, true purpose in life. The deepest ruling purpose
which we cherish, what we constantly strive for and determine to pursue as
the most real and precious thing of life, that rules us everywhere, that is our ego,
our life, is what will have its way at last. It will at last break through all disguise;
it will bring all external conduct into harmony with itself. If it be an
evil and selfish end, all external and fair moralities will melt away, and the man
will lose his common sense and exhibit his insanities of opinion and will and
answering deed on the surface. But if that end be good and innocent, and there
be humility within, the outward disorders and evils which result from one’s
heredity or surroundings will finally disappear.—<i>From Rev. John Goddard’s
discourse, July 1, 1894.</i></p>

<p>Putting aside the question as to whether the scheme of the soul’s development
after death was or was not revealed to Swedenborg, whether or not the
title of seer can be added to the claims of this learned student of science, all this
need not interfere with the moral influence of this work, although the weight of
its instruction must be greatly enforced on the minds of those who believe in a
later inspiration than the gospels.</p>

<p>This story begins where others end; the title of the first chapter, “I Die,”
commands attention; the process of the soul’s disenthralment is certainly in harmony
with what we sometimes read in the dim eyes of friends we follow to the
very gate of life. “By what power does a single spark hold to life so long ...
this lingering of the divine spark of life in a body growing cold?” It is the
mission of the author to tear from Death its long-established thoughts of horror,
and upon its entrance into a new life, the soul possesses such a power of adjustment
that no shock is experienced.—<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p>A capable critic writes: “One of the most beautiful, touching stories I have
read. The character of the old clerk is a masterpiece, a kind of Russian Charles
Lamb. He reminds me, too, of Anatole France’s ‘Sylvestre Bonnard,’ but it
is a more poignant, moving figure. How wonderfully, too, the sad little strokes
of humor are blended into the pathos in his characterization, and how fascinating
all the naive self-revelations of his poverty become,—all his many ups and downs
and hopes and fears. His unsuccessful visit to the money-lender, his despair at the
office, unexpectedly ending in a sudden burst of good fortune, the final despairing
cry of his love for Varvara,—these hold one breathless. One can hardly
read them without tears.... But there is no need to say all that could be said
about the book. It is enough to say that it is over powerful and beautiful.”</p>

<p>We are glad to welcome a good translation of the Russian Dostoievsky’s
story “Poor Folk,” Englished by Lena Milman. It is a tale of unrequited love,
conducted in the form of letters written between a poor clerk and his girl cousin
whom he devotedly loves, and who finally leaves him to marry a man not admirable
in character who, the reader feels, will not make her happy. The pathos of
the book centres in the clerk, Makar’s, unselfish affection and his heart-break at
being left lonesome by his charming kinswoman whose epistles have been his one
solace. In the conductment of the story, realistic sketches of middle-class Russian
life are given, heightening the effect of the denoument. George Moore writes
a sparkling introduction to the book.—<i>Hartford Courant.</i></p>

<p>Dostoievsky is a great artist. “Poor Folk” is a great novel.—<i>Boston
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>It is a most beautiful and touching story, and will linger in the mind long
after the book is closed. The pathos is blended with touching bits of humor,
that are even pathetic in themselves.—<i>Boston Times.</i></p>

<p>Notwithstanding that “Poor Folk” is told in that most exasperating and
entirely unreal style—by letters—it is complete in sequence, and the interest
does not flag as the various phases in the sordid life of the two characters are
developed. The theme is intensely pathetic and truly human, while its treatment
is exceedingly artistic. The translator, Lena Milman, seems to have well
preserved the spirit of the original.—<i>Cambridge Tribune.</i></p>

<p>A very remarkable story, which in a coarser hand than its refined and
gifted author could never have been effectively told; for such a hand could
not have sustained the purity of motive, nor have portrayed the noble,
irreproachable character of Herminia Barton.—<i>Boston Home Journal.</i></p>

<p>“The Woman Who Did” is a remarkable and powerful story. It
increases our respect for Mr. Allen’s ability, nor do we feel inclined to join
in throwing stones at him as a perverter of our morals and our social institutions.
However widely we may differ from Mr. Allen’s views on many
important questions, we are bound to recognize his sincerity, and to respect
him accordingly. It is powerful and painful, but it is not convincing.
Herminia Barton is a woman whose nobleness both of mind and of life we
willingly concede; but as she is presented to us by Mr. Allen, there is unmistakably
a flaw in her intellect. This in itself does not detract from
the reality of the picture.—<i>The Speaker.</i></p>

<p>George Egerton’s new volume entitled “Discords,” a collection of short stories,
is more talked about, just now, than any other fiction of the day. The collection is
really stories for story-writers. They are precisely the quality which literary folk will
wrangle over. Harold Frederic cables from London to the “New York Times” that
the book is making a profound impression there. It is published on both sides, the
Roberts House bringing it out in Boston. George Egerton, like George Eliot and
George Sand, is a woman’s <i>nom de plume</i>. The extraordinary frankness with which
life in general is discussed in these stories not unnaturally arrests attention.—<i>Lilian
Whiting.</i></p>

<p>The English woman, known as yet only by the name of George Egerton, who
made something of a stir in the world by a volume of strong stories called “Keynotes,”
has brought out a new book under the rather uncomfortable title of “Discords.”
These stories show us pessimism run wild; the gloomy things that can happen to a
human being are so dwelt upon as to leave the impression that in the author’s own
world there is no light. The relations of the sexes are treated of in bitter irony, which
develops into actual horror as the pages pass. But in all this there is a rugged
grandeur of style, a keen analysis of motive, and a deepness of pathos that stamp
George Egerton as one of the greatest women writers of the day. “Discords” has
been called a volume of stories; it is a misnomer, for the book contains merely varying
episodes in lives of men and women, with no plot, no beginning nor ending.—<i>Boston
Traveller.</i></p>

<p>This is a new volume of psychological stories from the pen and brains of George
Egerton, the author of “Keynotes.” Evidently the titles of the author’s books are
selected according to musical principles. The first story in the book is “A Psychological
Moment at Three Periods.” It is all strength rather than sentiment. The
story of the child, of the girl, and of the woman is told, and told by one to whom the
mysteries of the life of each are familiarly known. In their very truth, as the writer
has so subtly analyzed her triple characters, they sadden one to think that such things
must be; yet as they are real, they are bound to be disclosed by somebody and in due
time. The author betrays remarkable penetrative skill and perception, and dissects
the human heart with a power from whose demonstration the sensitive nature may
instinctively shrink even while fascinated with the narration and hypnotized by the
treatment exhibited.—<i>Courier.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">There</span> are,” says Henry James in one of his essays, “two writers in
Balzac,—the spontaneous one and the reflective one, the former of
which is much the more delightful, while the latter is the more extraordinary.”
It is the reflective Balzac, the Balzac with a theory, whom we
get in the “Deux Jeunes Mariées,” now translated by Miss Wormeley
under the title of “Memoirs of Two Young Married Women.” The
theory of Balzac is that the marriage of convenience, properly regarded,
is far preferable to the marriage simply from love, and he undertakes to
prove this proposition by contrasting the careers of two young girls who
have been fellow-students at a convent. One of them, the ardent and
passionate Louise de Chaulieu, has an intrigue with a Spanish refugee,
finally marries him, kills him, as she herself confesses, by her perpetual
jealousy and exaction, mourns his loss bitterly, then marries a golden-haired
youth, lives with him in a dream of ecstasy for a year or so, and
this time kills herself through jealousy wrongfully inspired. As for her
friend, Renée de Maucombe, she dutifully makes a marriage to please her
parents, calculates coolly beforehand how many children she will have and
how they shall be trained; insists, however, that the marriage shall be
merely a civil contract till she and her husband find that their hearts are
indeed one; and sees all her brightest visions realized—her Louis an
ambitious man for her sake and her children truly adorable creatures.
The story, which is told in the form of letters, fairly scintillates with
brilliant sayings, and is filled with eloquent discourses concerning the
nature of love, conjugal and otherwise. Louise and Renée are both
extremely sophisticated young women, even in their teens; and those
who expect to find in their letters the demure innocence of the Anglo-Saxon
type will be somewhat astonished. The translation, under the
circumstances, was rather a daring attempt, but it has been most felicitousy
done.—<i>The Beacon.</i></p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>It is, I think, one of the prettiest and most carefully constructed of her later
works, and the best view of the French Revolution from a rural point of view that
I know.—<i>Translator.</i></p>

<p>“Nanon” is a pure romance, chaste in style and with a charm of sentiment
well calculated to appeal to the most thoughtful reader. George Sand has chosen
the epoch of the French Revolution as the scene of this last theme from her prolific
pen, and she invests the time with all the terrible significance that belongs to
it. To the literary world nothing that comes from her pen is unwelcome, the more
so as in this instance there is not the least trace of that risky freedom of speech
that too often disfigures the best work of the French school of fiction. Nanon
will be read with an appreciation of the gifted novelist that is by no means new,
and her claim to recognition is made stronger and better by this masterly work.
Her admirers—and they will be sure not to miss Nanon—will feel a debt of
gratitude to Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer for a translation that preserves so well
the clear, flowing style and the lofty thoughts of the original; and the publishers,
no less than the reading public, ought to consider themselves fortunate in the
choice of so competent a translator.—<i>The American Hebrew.</i></p>

<p>This is among the finest of George Sand’s romances, and one who has not
made acquaintance with her works would do well to choose it as the introductory
volume. It belongs in the list of the best works of that remarkable author, and
contains nothing that is objectionable or at all questionable in its moral tone. The
scenes are laid among the peasantry of France—simple-hearted, plodding, honest
people, who know little or nothing of the causes which are fomenting to bring
about the French Revolution. She portrays in clear and forcible language the
destitute condition of the rural districts, whose people were ignorant, priest-ridden,
and oppressed; and she shows the wretchedness and misery that these poor people
were compelled to endure during the progress of the Revolution. The book is one
of her masterpieces, by reason of the exquisite delineations of character, the keen
and philosophical thought, the purity of inspiration, and the delicacy and refinement
of style. Throughout the story there is a freshness and vigor which only
one can feel who has lived at some time in close intimacy with fields and woods,
and become familiar with the forms, the colors, and the sounds of Nature. The
book has been translated by Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer, who has performed her
task admirably.—<i>Public Opinion.</i></p>

<p>Mrs. Latimer has achieved marked success in the translation of this charming
tale, preserving its purity, its simplicity, and its pastoral beauty.—<i>Christian
Union.</i></p>

<p>These two beautiful volumes, clad in the white garb which is emblematic of
the purity of married love as well as the innocence of childhood, make up a series
unique in its plan and almost perfect in its carrying out. It would be impossible

been selected with unerring taste and judgment, and include some of the most
exquisite poems in the language. Altogether the four volumes make up a
treasure-house of Love poetry unexcelled for sweetness and purity of expression.
<i>Transcript, Boston.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Chandler has drawn from many and diverse wells of English poetry of
Love, as the list for any month shows. The poetry of passion is not here, but
there are many strains of Love such as faithful lovers feel.—<i>Literary World,
Boston.</i></p>

<p>We do not hesitate to pronounce it a collection of extraordinary freshness and
merit. It is not in hackneyed rhymes that his lovers converse, but in fresh
metres from the unfailing fountains.—<i>Independent, New York.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Chandler is catholic in his tastes, and no author of repute has been
omitted who could give variety or strength to the work. The children have never
been reached in verse in a more comprehensive and connected manner than they
are in this book.—<i>Gazette, Boston.</i></p>

<p>A very dainty and altogether bewitching little anthology. For each day in
each month of two years (each series covering a year) a poem is given celebrating
the emotions that beset the heart of the true lover. The editor has shown his
exquisite taste in selection, and his wide and varied knowledge of the literature of
English and American poetry. Every poem in these books is a perfect gem of
sentiment; either tender, playful, reproachful, or supplicatory in its meaning;
there is not a sonnet nor a lyric that one could wish away.—<i>Beacon, Boston.</i></p>

<p>“The selections,” says Louise Chandler Moulton, “given us are nearly all
interesting, and some of them are not only charming but unhackneyed.”—<i>Herald,
Boston.</i></p>

<p>A collection of Love poems selected with exquisite judgment from the best
known English and American poets of the last three centuries, with a few translations.—<i>Home
Journal, Boston.</i></p>

<p>There are many beautiful poems gathered into this treasure-house, and so
great is the variety which has been given to the whole that the monotony which
would seem to be the necessary accompaniment of the choice of a single theme
is overcome.—<i>Courier, Boston.</i></p>

<p>The selections are not fragments, but are for the most part complete poems.
Nearly every one of the poems is a literary gem, and they represent nearly all
the famous names in poetry.—<i>Daily Advertiser, Boston.</i></p>

<p>Selected with great taste and judgment from a wide variety of sources, and
providing a body of verse of the highest order.—<i>Commercial Advertiser,
Buffalo.</i></p>
